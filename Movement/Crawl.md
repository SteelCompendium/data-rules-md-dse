##### Crawl

If you are prone (see [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2)), you can remain prone and crawl on the ground. Doing so costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. If you intentionally want to crawl, you can fall prone as a free maneuver. While voluntarily prone, you can choose to stand as a free maneuver.
