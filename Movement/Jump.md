##### Jump

Whenever an effect allows you to move (including using the Advance move action), you can automatically long jump a number of squares up to your Might or Agility score (your choice; minimum 1 square) as part of that movement. The height of your jump is automatically 1 square as part of that movement.

If you want to jump even longer or higher than your baseline jump allows, make a Might or Agility test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **â‰¤11:** You don't jump any farther than your baseline jump allows.
- **12-16:** You jump 1 square longer and higher than your baseline jump allows.
- **17+:** You jump 2 squares longer and higher than your baseline jump allows.

You can't jump farther or higher than the distance of the effect that allows you to move. You can't jump out of difficult terrain or damaging terrain (see below).
