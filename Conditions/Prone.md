##### Prone

While a creature is prone, they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A prone creature must crawl to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can't climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked prone, they fall.

Unless the ability or effect that imposed the prone condition says otherwise, a prone creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver (see [Maneuvers](#page-287-0) in [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0)). A creature adjacent to a willing prone creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.
