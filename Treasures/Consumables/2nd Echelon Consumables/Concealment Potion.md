##### Concealment Potion

*This dark, viscous liquid tastes like burnt leaves.*

**Keywords:** Potion, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** An ounce of sap from a tree damaged by psionic fire

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Agility or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 90

**Effect:** When you drink this potion as a maneuver, light shifts around your body, letting you blend into the environment around you for 10 minutes. While this effect is active, you have a double edge on tests made to hide and sneak, and you can use the Hide maneuver even while you are observed.
