##### Float Powder

*A glass vial holds translucent flakes that twinkle in the light.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** Several strands of hag hair

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Khelt

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Intuition or Presence

**Project Goal:** 90 (yields 1d3 vials)

**Effect:** Dousing yourself in this powder as a maneuver causes you to weightlessly float off the ground. For 1 hour, your stability is reduced to 0, and you can fly and hover. Additionally, the hag that the powder is sourced from knows exactly where and when you use it.
