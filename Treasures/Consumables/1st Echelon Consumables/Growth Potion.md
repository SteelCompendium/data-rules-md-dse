##### Growth Potion

*This thick green liquid tastes of licorice and potatoes.*

**Keywords:** Magic, Potion

**Item Prerequisite:** A half-pound of seagrass

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 45

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you can drink this potion or pour it over an object of size 2 or smaller, causing the target's size to increase by 1(to a minimum size of 2). If you are the target, your Stamina maximum and Stability are doubled, you gain an edge on Might tests, and your weapon abilities that deal rolled damage gain a damage bonus equal to your highest characteristic score. You shrink back to your original size after 3 rounds, halving your current Stamina maximum and Stability, and losing the potion's other benefits. Objects maintain their new size permanently.
