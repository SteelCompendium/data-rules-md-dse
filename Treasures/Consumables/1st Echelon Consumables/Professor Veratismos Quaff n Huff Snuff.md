##### Professor Veratismo's Quaff 'n Huff Snuff

*This tiny compact holds a colorless powder with the slightest astringent smell.*

**Keywords:** Potion, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** The roots of a just-budded nightshade

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason

**Project Goal:** 45

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you sprinkle a dose of this powder onto food or drink, or blow it at an adjacent creature who is grabbed, restrained, or unconscious. A creature who is exposed to blown powder (even if they hold their breath) or consumes a dose of the powder must communicate in only true statements for 1 hour. Additionally, other creatures gain an edge on Intuition and Presence tests made to convince the target to communicate, or to read the target's emotions. Any such creature has a double edge on the test if the target doesn't realize they've been affected by the snuff.
