##### Lachomp Tooth

*A thumb-sized serrated tooth manages to scratch your flesh in some way whenever it is handled.*

**Keywords:** Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** A leftover carcass of a lachomp meal

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 45 (yields 1d3 teeth)

**Effect:** As a maneuver, you attach a lachomp tooth to a weapon, allowing that weapon to supernaturally flicker in and out of reality. Your next strike that uses the weapon can tear through multiple targets in a line (for a ranged strike) or surrounding you (for a melee strike). The strike adds the following effects to the tier outcomes of the power roll:

- **â‰¤11:** You can affect one additional target with this strike.
- **12-16:** You can affect up to three additional targets with this strike.
- **17+:** You can affect up to seven additional targets with this strike.
