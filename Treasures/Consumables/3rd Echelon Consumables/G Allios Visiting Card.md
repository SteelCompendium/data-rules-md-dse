##### G'Allios Visiting Card

*A card bearing the Eighth City Advocacy Services crest smells faintly of smoke and spices.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** One vial of archdevil's blood, an expired contract

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Anjali

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 180

**Effect:** Whenever you would take damage, you can use a triggered action to tear the card and summon a devil. You avoid the damage and any accompanying effects, and the devil redirects the triggering effect to a target of their choice anywhere on the same manifold. You are treated to a clear vision of whoever suffers the damage. The devil then disappears.
