##### Authority's End

*This long, sinuous chain is composed entirely of broken links held together by unseen power.*

**Keywords:** Psionic, Whip

**Item Prerequisite:** A lash used to punish a mutineer

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Khelt

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason, Intuition, or Presence

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** Any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using this weapon gains a +1 damage bonus. Whenever you damage a creature with the weapon, you can immediately use a maneuver to end one effect imposed by that creature on you or another creature within 5 squares of you.

**5th Level:** The weapon's damage bonus increases to +2. Additionally, you and each ally within 2 squares of you gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**9th Level:** The weapon's damage bonus increases to +3. Additionally, you no longer need to use a maneuver to end one effect when you damage a creature with the weapon. The weapon also refuses to vie for control of your psyche, and no longer counts against the limit of leveled treasures you can carry safely.
