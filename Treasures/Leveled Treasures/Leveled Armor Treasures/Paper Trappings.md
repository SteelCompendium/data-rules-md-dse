##### Paper Trappings

*This delicate robe is made from thousands of pages torn from books, intricately folded together without a single thread to bind them.*

**Keywords:** Light Armor, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** Ten pages from each of a hundred different books

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Anjali

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Might, Reason, or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** While you wear this armor, you gain a +6 bonus to Stamina. Additionally, you can use a main action to fold in on yourself until you and your gear are paper thin. This effect lasts for 1 minute, letting you easily slip through any opening that is 1 inch wide or more. When you return to your three-dimensional form, you are dazed for 1 minute. If you return to your true form while in a space that is too small for you, you are violently expelled into the nearest open space of your choice and take 3d6 damage.

**5th Level:** The armor's bonus to Stamina increases to +12, and when you return to your true form, you are dazed only until the end of your next turn. Additionally, while you are paper thin, you can use a maneuver to wrap yourself around an adjacent target who is the same size or smaller than you, automatically grabbing them.

**9th Level:** The armor's bonus to Stamina increases to +21, and you are no longer dazed when you return to your true form. Additionally, while you have a target grabbed when you are paper thin, you can use a maneuver to constrict the target, dealing 10 damage to them. A creature damaged this way takes a bane when using the Escape Grab maneuver against you and when making strikes against you.
