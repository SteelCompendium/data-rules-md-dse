##### Lightning Treads

*Sparks strike from these boots whenever they touch the ground, increasing in number as the wearer gathers speed.*

**Keywords:** Feet, Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** One jar of lightning

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Yllyric

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Agility, Reason, or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 450

**1st Level:** While you wear these boots, any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using your unarmed strikes deals an extra 1 lightning damage. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to speed.

**5th Level:** The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 2. Additionally, for each square you move on your turn before you use a weapon ability that deals rolled damage using your unarmed strikes, this extra damage increases by 1 (to a maximum of 4).

**9th Level:** The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 3, and your movement can increase that extra damage to a maximum of 6. Additionally, you can use a maneuver to perform a flying lightning kick on one adjacent creature. That target is pushed up to 5 squares, and you can move to any square adjacent to the target after the push.
