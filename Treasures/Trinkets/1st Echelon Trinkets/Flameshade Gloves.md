##### Flameshade Gloves

*These finely stitched gloves appear to flicker in and out of reality when first handled.*

**Keywords:** Hands, Psionic

**Item Prerequisite:** A humanoid's shadow disconnected from its source

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Khelt

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason

**Project Goal:** 150

**Effect:** When you use a move action while wearing these gloves, you can place one hand upon a mundane object as part of that move action. If the object is 1 square thick or less and has open space on the other side (for example, a door or wall), you pull your body through it as though the object wasn't there.

If the object is too thick or has no open space on the other side, your hand becomes stuck inside the object. Removing your hand takes a successful hard Might test made as a main action.
