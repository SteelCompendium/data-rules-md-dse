##### Deadweight

*Though this humanoid femur is coated in lead, it feels impossibly heavy for its size.*

**Keywords:** Magic

**Item Prerequisite:** One humanoid femur, one bar of lead laced with starmetal

**Project Source:** Texts or lore in Caelian

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason or Intuition

**Project Goal:** 150

**Effect:** While holding the Deadweight, you fall twice as fast, taking an extra 1 damage for each square you fall (to a maximum of 75 total damage from a single fall). If you fall 5 or more squares this way, you can make a melee free strike as a free maneuver once during the fall before you hit the ground.
