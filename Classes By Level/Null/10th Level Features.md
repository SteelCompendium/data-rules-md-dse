### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility and Intuition scores each increase to 5.

#### Discipline Mastery Improvement

Your Discipline Mastery feature provides additional benefits when you have 12 or more discipline.

#### Manifold Body

When you gain discipline at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 discipline instead of 3.

#### Manifold Resonance

Your body becomes perfected matter, beyond the whims and chaos of the timescape and the restrictions of the manifolds. Each time you finish a respite, you can shift yourself and any creatures in the area of your Null Field ability to any location in the timescape known to you, known to any other creature in the area, or where any supernatural treasure in the area has been before.

Whenever you use an ability, you gain 1 discipline that can be used only to apply a benefit from your Psi Boost feature to that ability. Additionally, you and allies in the area of your Null Field ability ignore banes and double banes on your power rolls.

#### Order

You have an epic resource called order. Each time you finish a respite, you gain order equal to the XP you gain. You can spend order on your abilities as if it were discipline.

At the start of a combat encounter, you can spend 1 order to increase the size of your Null Field by 1 until the end of the encounter.

Order remains until you spend it.

#### Perk

You gain one exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
