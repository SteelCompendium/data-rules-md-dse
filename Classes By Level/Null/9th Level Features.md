### 9th-Level Features

As a 9th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### I Am the Weapon

Your Stamina increases by 21 and you can't be made bleeding even while dying. You no longer age or have need of food. Additionally, you can use Intuition instead of another characteristic when resisting potencies.

#### 9th-Level Tradition Ability

Your null tradition grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

##### 9th-Level Chronokinetic Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Arrestor Cycle (11 Discipline)

*You trap your foe in a looping cycle of time, where they relive the last few seconds over and over again.*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |  **Free triggered** |
| ------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The triggering creature starts their turn.

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- **≤11:** I < WEAK, the target loses their turn
- **12-16:** I < AVERAGE, the target loses their turn
- **17+:** I < STRONG, the target loses their turn

**Effect:** If the target loses their turn, the round continues as if they had acted. A target who doesn't lose their turn takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score for each main action they take until the end of their next turn.

###### Time Loop (11 Discipline)

*You show shadows what true speed is.*

| **Psionic** | **Free triggered** |
| ----------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 Self** |        **🎯 Self** |

**Trigger:** Another creature on the encounter map ends their turn.

**Effect:** You take a bonus turn immediately after the triggering creature. This ability can be used only once per combat round.

##### 9th-Level Cryokinetic Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Absolute Zero (11 Discipline)

*You become the coldest thing in the timescape.*

| **Psionic** | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **📏 Self** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- **≤11:** You gain 20 temporary Stamina.
- **12-16:** You gain 30 temporary Stamina.
- **17+:** You gain 40 temporary Stamina.

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dead, you become an avatar of uttermost cold. You gain immunity to all damage equal to the cold damage immunity granted by your Entropic Adaptability trait, you ignore the negative effects of dying, and you have a +2 bonus to potencies.

###### Heat Drain (11 Discipline)

*You drain all the heat from the target.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike** |        **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**             | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- **≤11:** 8 + I cold damage; M < WEAK, restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 11 + I cold damage; M < AVERAGE, restrained (save ends)
- **17+:** 15 + I cold damage; M < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** While restrained this way, the target takes cold damage equal to your Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. Additionally, whenever the target damages another creature while restrained this way, any potency associated with the damage is reduced by 2.

##### 9th-Level Metakinetic Abilities

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Inertial Absorption (11 Discipline)

*You absorb an attack to empower your body.*

| **Psionic** | **Free triggered** |
| ----------- | -----------------: |
| **📏 Self** |        **🎯 Self** |

**Trigger:** Another creature damages you using an ability.

**Effect:** You take half the damage, negate any effects associated with the damage for you, and gain 3 surges.

###### Realitas (11 Discipline)

*Your essential hyperreality disrupts your enemy's connection to existence.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 7 + A psychic damage; I < WEAK, dazed
- **12-16:** 10 + A psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, dazed
- **17+:** 13 + A psychic damage; I < STRONG, dazed

**Effect:** While dazed this way, the target takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. If this ability causes a creature who is not a leader or solo creature to become winded, they are instead reduced to 0 Stamina. Any creature reduced to 0 Stamina by this ability is forgotten by all creatures of your level or lower in the timescape who are not present in the encounter. Loved ones of the forgotten creature retain a faint sense of melancholy. This effect can be reversed only at the Director's discretion.
