### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level Tradition Feature

Your null tradition grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 8th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition     | Feature           |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Chronokinetic | Shared Momentum   |
| Cryokinetic   | Synaptic Triage   |
| Metakinetic   | Inertial Dampener |

##### Inertial Dampener

You and each creature or object of your choice in the area of your Null Field ability gain a bonus to stability equal to your Intuition score. A creature who attempts to force move a target with this bonus takes psychic damage equal to your Intuition score.

##### Shared Momentum

When you take the Disengage move action, one ally in the area of your Null Field ability can also take the Disengage move action as a free triggered action, using your distance for that move action.

##### Synaptic Triage

As a free maneuver, you can spend 1d6 Stamina to remove one effect on you. Each creature of your choice in the area of your Null Field ability also gains this benefit.

#### 11-Discipline Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 discipline to use.

###### Arcane Purge (11 Discipline)

*You focus your null field into a pressure point strike that prevents your foe from channeling sorcery.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**                     | **üéØ One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 13 + A damage; M < WEAK, the target is suppressed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 19 + A damage; M < AVERAGE, the target is suppressed (save ends)
- **17+:** 24 + A damage; M < STRONG, the target is suppressed (save ends)

**Effect:** While suppressed, a target takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score at the start of their turns, whenever they use a supernatural ability, or whenever they use an ability that costs Malice.

###### Phase Hurl (11 Discipline)

*You throw your foe out of phase with this manifold, causing them to harm other enemies as they return.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**                     | **üéØ One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 9 + A damage; push 5; I < WEAK, dazed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 13 + A damage; push 7; I < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** 18 + A damage; push 10; I < STRONG, dazed (save ends)

**Effect:** The target and each creature or object they collide with from this forced movement takes psychic damage equal to the total number of squares the target was force moved. While the target is dazed this way, they see glimpses of creatures from other parts of the timescape.

###### Scalar Assault (11 Discipline)

*You warp reality to grow a limb for just a moment and make a single devastating attack.*

| **Area, Psionic**      |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 3 cube within 1** | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 12 psychic damage; push 3
- **12-16:** 17 psychic damage; push 5
- **17+:** 23 psychic damage; push 7

###### Synaptic Anchor (11 Discipline)

*You disrupt an enemy's strike and create a feedback loop in their mind, preventing them from focusing on future attacks.*

| **Psionic**            |          **Free triggered** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------: |
| **üìè Self; see below** | **üéØ Self or one creature** |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage from another creature's ability while in the area of your Null Field ability.

**Effect:** The target takes half the damage, and if the triggering crea ture has I < AVERAGE, they are dazed (save ends). While the triggering creature is dazed this way, they take psychic damage equal to your Intuition score whenever they use a main action.
