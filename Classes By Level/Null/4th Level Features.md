### 4th-Level Features

As a 4th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility and Intuition scores each increase to 3.

#### Discipline Mastery Improvement

Your Discipline Mastery feature provides additional benefits when you have 8 or more discipline.

#### Enhanced Null Field

While using your Null Field ability, you disrupt magic and psionic power suffusing the area around you. During combat, any temporary supernatural terrain effects of your level or lower are removed when your aura partially or fully overlaps with their location. Permanent supernatural terrain effects of your level or lower are temporarily negated while your aura overlaps with their location, but return when the aura no longer overlaps with them.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Regenerative Field

The first time each combat round that an enemy in the area of your Null Field ability uses a main action, you gain 2 discipline instead of 1.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice. See Skills in Chapter 9: Tests.

As a 5th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Tradition Feature

Your null tradition grants you a feature, as shown on the 5th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 5th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition     | Feature            |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Chronokinetic | Instant Action     |
| Cryokinetic   | Chilling Readiness |
| Metakinetic   | Inertial Fulcrum   |

#### Chilling Readiness

You steel yourself for imminent danger by tapping into your body's cold energy. At the start of any combat, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories.

#### Inertial Fulcrum

Whenever you use an ability to reduce damage dealt to you or to reduce the distance of forced movement imposed upon you, you can deal damage to one enemy in the area of your Null Field ability equal to your Intuition score.

#### Instant Action

If you're not surprised at the start of your first turn in combat, you gain an edge on ability rolls and gain 2 surges. If you are surprised, you can spend 3 discipline to no longer be surprised and gain the benefits of this feature.

#### 9-Discipline Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 discipline to use.

###### Anticipating Strike (9 Discipline)

*You suddenly strike an enemy, then grab them in a psionically enhanced grip.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |  **Free triggered** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**                     | **üéØ One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target moves or uses a main action.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 7 + A damage; I < WEAK, restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 + A damage; I < AVERAGE, restrained (save ends)
- **17+:** 13 + A damage; I < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** This strike resolves before the triggering movement or main action.

###### Iron Grip (9 Discipline)

*You grab the target with supernatural force.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**                     | **üéØ One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 10 + A damage; A < WEAK, grabbed
- **12-16:** 14 + A damage; A < AVERAGE, grabbed
- **17+:** 18 + A damage; A < STRONG, grabbed

**Effect:** While grabbed this way, the target takes a bane on the Escape Grab maneuver. Each time they use that maneuver, they take damage equal to twice your Agility score.

###### Phase Leap (9 Discipline)

*You leap beyond reality, leaving an afterimage of yourself.*

| **Psionic** |    **Move** |
| ----------- | ----------: |
| **üìè Self** | **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** You jump up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Until the end of your next turn, a static afterimage of you remains in the space you left, and any enemy adjacent to your afterimage takes a bane on ability rolls. You can use your abilities from your own space or from the space of your afterimage as if you were still there. Additionally, if your Null Field ability is active, your afterimage also projects the aura from that ability, which you control as if you were in the afterimage's space.

###### Synaptic Reset (9 Discipline)

*You expand your nullifying power to mitigate harmful effects.*

| **Area, Psionic** |                          **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **üìè 3 burst**    | **üéØ Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can end any conditions or effects on themself, and gains 5 temporary Stamina for each condition or effect removed.
