### 4th-Level Features

As a 4th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility and Intuition scores each increase to 3.

#### Discipline Mastery Improvement

Your Discipline Mastery feature provides additional benefits when you have 8 or more discipline.

#### Enhanced Null Field

While using your Null Field ability, you disrupt magic and psionic power suffusing the area around you. During combat, any temporary supernatural terrain effects of your level or lower are removed when your aura partially or fully overlaps with their location. Permanent supernatural terrain effects of your level or lower are temporarily negated while your aura overlaps with their location, but return when the aura no longer overlaps with them.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Regenerative Field

The first time each combat round that an enemy in the area of your Null Field ability uses a main action, you gain 2 discipline instead of 1.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice. See Skills in Chapter 9: Tests.
