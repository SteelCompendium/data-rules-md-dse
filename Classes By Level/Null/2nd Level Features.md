### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level null, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level Tradition Feature

Your null tradition grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 2nd-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition     | Feature               |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Chronokinetic | Rapid Processing      |
| Cryokinetic   | Entropic Adaptability |

##### Entropic Adaptability

You have cold immunity equal to twice your Intuition score. Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain related to cold and ice, and you can automatically climb at full speed while moving.

##### Inertial Sink

You add your Intuition score to your effective size for the purpose of interacting with creatures and objects, such as for determining whether you can lift an object, whether you are affected by forced movement, and so forth. This has no effect on whether you can be grabbed.

Additionally, when you fall, you reduce the effective height of the fall by 5 squares in addition to any other reductions. Whenever you take damage from being force moved, you reduce that damage by an amount equal to your level.
