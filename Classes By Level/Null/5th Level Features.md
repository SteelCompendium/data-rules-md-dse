### 5th-Level Features

As a 5th-level null, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Tradition Feature

Your null tradition grants you a feature, as shown on the 5th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 5th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition     | Feature            |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Chronokinetic | Instant Action     |
| Cryokinetic   | Chilling Readiness |
| Metakinetic   | Inertial Fulcrum   |

#### Chilling Readiness

You steel yourself for imminent danger by tapping into your body's cold energy. At the start of any combat, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories.

#### Inertial Fulcrum

Whenever you use an ability to reduce damage dealt to you or to reduce the distance of forced movement imposed upon you, you can deal damage to one enemy in the area of your Null Field ability equal to your Intuition score.

#### Instant Action

If you're not surprised at the start of your first turn in combat, you gain an edge on ability rolls and gain 2 surges. If you are surprised, you can spend 3 discipline to no longer be surprised and gain the benefits of this feature.

#### 9-Discipline Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 discipline to use.
