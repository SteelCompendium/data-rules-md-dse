### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level tactician, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Might and Reason scores each increase to 5.

#### Command

You have an epic resource called command. Each time you finish a respite, you gain command equal to the XP you gain. You can spend command on your abilities as if it were focus.

Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to increase the power roll outcome for that target by one tier. Whenever an enemy marked by you makes an ability roll, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to decrease the power roll outcome by one tier.

Command remains until you spend it.

#### Perk

You gain one exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

#### True Focus

When you gain focus at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 focus instead of 3.

#### Warmaster

You have mastered the entirety of possible strategies and tactics. Whenever you or any ally makes an ability roll against a target marked by you, the character making the roll can roll three dice and choose which two to use.

Additionally, whenever an ally uses a heroic ability that targets one or more creatures marked by you, they spend 2 fewer of their Heroic Resource on that ability (minimum 1).
