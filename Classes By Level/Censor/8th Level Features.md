###### 8th-Level Order Features Table

| Order    | Feature             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Exorcist | Demonologist        |
| Oracle   | Their Past Revealed |
| Paragon  | Vow                 |

##### Demonologist

The most esoteric secrets of your order teach you that to defeat your enemy, you must understand them. You treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual when dealing with demons, devils, and other agents of chaos. If you successfully complete a negotiation with one of these creatures, you gain an edge on power rolls made against them and can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action before an encounter begins.

##### Their Past Revealed

Your constant fragmentary visions become clearer, and can be honed to understand the past of creatures you interact with. While speaking with any creature, you can make a medium Presence test to see visions from their past. On a success, you see a clear view of any subject related to the creature's past that you wish to understand. On a success with a consequence, you see two visions, one false and one true. On a failure, you lose 2d6 Stamina.

##### Vow

Your words take on the power of your deity, with all the authority that entails. If you convince a creature to take an oath, they can't break it for 7 days. If you take an oath, you can't break it for 7 days.
