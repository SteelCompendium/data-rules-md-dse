### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level censor, you gain the following features.

#### Censor Order

Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act as your god's agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Paragon.)

- **Exorcist:** You specialize in hunting your order's hidden enemies, knowing that an open mind is an unguarded fortress. You have the Read Person skill.
- **Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed, leading you to specialize in uncovering clandestine threats to your order. You have the Magic skill.
- **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be corrupted. You specialize in setting an example for your order. You have the Lead skill.

Your censor order is your subclass, and your choice of order determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Deity and Domains

Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick one domain from their portfolio. Your choice of domain determines many of the features you'll gain from this class. (*Quick Build:* Cavall as deity and War as domain.)

#### Wrath

The power you serve grants you a Heroic Resource called wrath, fueling your abilities as you censor those your church deems to be heretics.

##### Wrath in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain wrath equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 wrath.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature judged by you (see [Judgment](#page-94-0) below) deals damage to you, you gain 1 wrath. The first time each combat round that you deal damage to a creature judged by you, you gain 1 wrath.

You lose any remaining wrath at the end of the encounter.

##### Wrath Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain wrath outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost wrath without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs wrath, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited wrath on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of wrath equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the censor, but they might appear in future products.)

#### Judgment

You pick out the enemies most worthy of your wrath and place a divine judgment upon them, censoring them with the power of your god. You have the following ability.

###### Judgment

*You utter a prayer that outlines your foe in holy energy.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |     **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ---------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**  | **üéØ One enemy** |

**Effect:** The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you use this ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action required), or another censor judges the target.

Whenever a creature judged by you uses a main action and is within your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.

When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target.

Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free triggered actions:

- When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you make a melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn, preventing them from shifting.
- When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you cause them to take a bane on the roll.
- When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability with a potency that targets only one creature, the potency is reduced by 1 for that creature.
- If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time, even if multiple options are triggered by the same effect.

##### Judgment Order Benefit

The first time on a turn that you use your Judgment ability to judge a creature, you gain the following benefit based on your order:

- **Exorcist:** You can teleport up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged creature. You do not need line of effect to your destination.
- **Oracle:** You can deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to the judged creature.
- **Paragon:** You can vertical pull the judged creature up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.

#### Kit

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See [Chapter 6: Kits](#page-231-0) for more information. (*Quick Build:* Warrior Priest.)

#### My Life for Yours

You channel your will to mend your wounds or the wounds of your allies. You have the following ability.

###### My Life for Yours

*You channel some of your vitality into more resilience for you or an ally.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**  | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn or takes damage.

**Effect:** You spend a Recovery and the target regains Stamina equal to your recovery value.

**Spend 1 Wrath:** You can end one effect on the target that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or a prone target can stand up.

#### 1st-Level Domain Feature

You gain a domain feature from your domain, as shown on the 1st-Level Censor Domain Features table. Additionally, you gain a skill from your domain, chosen from the skill group indicated on the table.

| War        | Sanctified Weapon             | Exploration   |

##### Blessing of Compassion

You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

##### Blessing of Comprehension

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. You are considered fluent in all languages for the purpose of understanding the project source for any crafting or research project (see [Chapter 12: Downtime Projects](#page-307-2)).

##### Blessing of Fortunate Weather

Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:

**Clear:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.

**Foggy:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.

**Overcast:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.

**Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.

If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.

##### Faithful Friend

You have the following ability.

###### Faithful Friend

*An animal spirit is drawn to you, sharing their senses with you and serving you faithfully.*

| **Magic**   | **Main action** |
| ----------- | --------------: |
| **üìè Self** |     **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.

##### Grave Speech

You have the following ability.

###### Grave Speech

*You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.*

| **Magic**      |             **Maneuver** |
| -------------- | -----------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1** | **üéØ One dead creature** |

**Effect:** You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

##### Hands of the Maker

You have the following ability.

###### Hands of the Maker

*You craft objects with the power of your mind.*

| **Magic**   | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **üìè Self** |  **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** You create a mundane object of size 1S or smaller. You can maintain a number of objects created this way equal to your Presence score. You can destroy an object created this way with a thought, no matter how far you are from it (no action required).

##### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Inspired Deception

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Presence on the test instead of another characteristic.

##### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

##### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

##### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Sanctified Weapon

As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Censor Abilities

You use a blend of martial techniques and divine magic to attack your foes and defend your allies.

##### Signature Ability

Choose one signature ability from the following options. Signature abilities can be used at will. (*Quick Build:* Your Allies Cannot Save You!)
