### 3rd-Level Features

As a 3rd-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Scan

You can extend your psionic senses beyond their usual range. Once on each of your turns, you can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests). Additionally, once you establish line of effect to a thinking creature within distance of your Mind Spike ability, you always have line of effect to that creature until they move beyond that distance.

#### 7-Clarity Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 7 clarity to use.

<!-- -->
> ###### Fling Through Time (7 Clarity)
>
> *You hurl the target through the annals of time, forcing them to witness every moment of their existence all at once.*
>
> | **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |               **Main action** |
> | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**                             | **🎯 One creature or object** |
>
> **Power Roll + Presence:**
>
> - **≤11:** 3 + P corruption damage; P < WEAK, weakened (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 5 + P corruption damage; the target is flung through time, and if P < AVERAGE, they are weakened (save ends)
> - **17+:** 8 + P corruption damage; the target is flung through time, and if P < STRONG, they are weakened (save ends)
>
> **Effect:** A target who is flung through time is removed from the encounter map until the end of their next turn, reappearing in their original space or the nearest unoccupied space.
>
> **Strained:** You take 2d6 damage and permanently grow visibly older (the equivalent of 10 years for a human). If you obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll, you gain 2 clarity.

<!-- -->
> ###### Force Orbs (7 Clarity)
>
> *Spheres of solid psionic energy float around you.*
>
> | **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telekinesis** | **Main action** |
> | ---------------------------------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Self; see below**                   |     **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Effect:** You create three size 1T orbs that orbit your body. Each orb gives you a cumulative damage immunity 1. Each time you take damage, you lose 1 orb.
>
> Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to fire an orb at a creature or object within 5 squares as a ranged strike, losing the orb after the strike.
>
> **Power Roll + Reason:**
>
> - **≤11:** 2 damage
> - **12-16:** 3 damage
> - **17+:** 5 damage
>
> **Strained:** You create five orbs, and you are weakened while you have any orbs active.

<!-- -->
> ###### Reflector Field (7 Clarity)
>
> *A protective field reverses the momentum of incoming attacks.*
>
> | **Area, Psionic, Telepathy** | **Main action** |
> | ---------------------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 3 aura**                |  **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** The aura lasts until the start of your next turn. Whenever an enemy targets an ally in the area with a ranged ability, the ability is negated on the ally and reflected back at the enemy. The ability deals half the damage to the enemy that it would have dealt to the ally and loses any additional effects.
>
> **Strained:** The size of the aura increases by 1. Whenever your aura reflects an ability, you take 2d6 damage and forget a memory, as determined by you and the Director.

<!-- -->
> ###### Soul Burn (7 Clarity)
>
> *You blast their soul out of their body, leaving it to helplessly float back to a weakened husk.*
>
> | **Animapathy, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |     **Main action** |
> | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**                            | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + Presence:**
>
> - **≤11:** 6 + P damage; P < WEAK, dazed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 10 + P damage; P < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
> - **17+:** 14 + P damage; P < STRONG, dazed (save ends)
>
> **Effect:** The target takes a bane on Presence tests until the end of the encounter.
>
> **Strained:** The potency of this ability increases by 1. You take 2d6 damage and gain 3 surges that you can use immediately.
