### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Reason and Presence scores each increase to 5.

#### Clear Mind

The first time each combat round that a creature is force moved, you gain 3 clarity instead of 2.

#### Omnisensory

You have a +10 bonus to the distance of your ranged abilities. Addition ally, you don't need line of effect to a target of a ranged ability if the target is a creature capable of thought who you have previously had line of effect to.

#### Perk

You gain one interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Psion

At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 + 2 clarity instead of 1d3 + 1.

Additionally, you can choose to not take damage from having negative clarity. You can also choose to take on any ability's strained effect even if you're not strained.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

#### Vision

You have an epic resource called vision. Each time you finish a respite, you gain vision equal to the XP you gain. You can spend vision on your abilities as if it were clarity.

Additionally, you can spend vision to use one additional psionic ability on your turn, provided you pay the entire cost of the ability in vision. If you choose to use a psionic ability that usually costs no clarity, you must spend 1 vision to use it.

Vision remains until you spend it.
