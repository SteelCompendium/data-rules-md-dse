### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level talent, you gain the following features.

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level Tradition Features

Your talent tradition grants you two features, as shown on the 8th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 8th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition   | Features                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Chronopathy | Doubling the Hours, Stasis Shield |
| Telekinesis | Levitation Field, Low Gravity     |
| Telepathy   | Mindlink, Universal Connection    |

##### Doubling the Hours

While you have 5 or more Victories, you can undertake an additional respite activity during a respite.

##### Levitation Field

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Levitation Field
>
> *You manipulate the air around your allies so they can move as freely through the sky as you can.*
>
> | **Area, Psionic** |                 **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | ---------------------------: |
> | **📏 3 burst**    | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target can fly until the start of your next turn, and can immediately shift up to their speed. You can also shift up to your speed. While flying, a target's stability is reduced to 0 and can't be increased.
>
> **Spend 5 Clarity:** The effects last for 1 hour instead.

##### Low Gravity

Your mind can carry your body through tough times. You ignore difficult terrain and don't need to spend additional movement while prone.

##### Mindlink

During a respite, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Reason score who you have communicated with using your Telepathic Speech feature, creating a telepathic link among all of you. Whenever a linked creature spends one or more Recoveries, each other linked creature can spend a Recovery.

#### Stasis Shield

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Stasis Shield (3 Clarity)
>
> *You freeze time just long enough to bring the victim to safety!*

> | ------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self, or one creature or object** |
>
> **Trigger:** The target takes damage.
>
> **Effect:** The target is teleported to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, taking no damage and suffering no additional effects if this movement would get them out of harm's way.
>
> **Strained:** You can't target yourself, and you take the damage and any additional effects instead of the target.

#### Universal Connection

The range of your Telepathic Speech feature increases to anywhere on the same world.

#### 11-Clarity Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 clarity to use.
