### 5th-Level Features

As a 5th-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Tradition Features

Your talent tradition grants you two features, as shown on the 5th-Level Tradition Features table.

###### 5th-Level Tradition Features Table

| Tradition   | Features                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Chronopathy | Distortion Temporal, Speed of Thought |
| Telekinesis | Kinetic Amplifier, Triangulate        |
| Telepathy   | Compulsion, Remote Amplification      |

##### Compulsion

Whenever you obtain a success on a test using a skill from the interpersonal skill group while interacting with an NPC, you can ask them a question using your Telepathic Speech feature. The NPC must answer the question truthfully to the best of their ability.

##### Distortion Temporal

While you are not dying, time behaves irregularly around you in a 3 aura. That area is difficult terrain for enemies. Additionally, when an ally enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there, they gain a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the turn.

##### Kinetic Amplifier

Whenever you force move a creature, you can spend up to 2 surges. For each surge spent, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score.

##### Remote Amplification

The distance of your ranged psionic abilities increases by 5. Additionally, the range of your Telepathic Speech feature increases to 1 mile.

##### Speed of Thought

Once per combat round while you are not dying, you can spend 2 clarity when you use a triggered action to turn it into a free triggered action.

##### Triangulate

Whenever an ally uses a ranged ability while you are within the ability's distance, you can spend 1 clarity as a free triggered action to allow them to use the ability as if they were in your space.

#### 9-Clarity Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 clarity to use.

###### Exothermic Shield (9 Clarity)

*You encase the target in psionic flame and allow them to flicker without fear of burning out.*

| **Pyrokinesis, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                 | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target has cold immunity 10 and fire immunity 10, and their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score. Additionally, whenever an enemy uses a melee ability against the target while they are under this effect, the enemy takes 5 fire damage.

**Strained:** The target gains 2 surges. You are weakened and slowed (save ends).

###### Hypersonic (9 Clarity)

*You move fast enough to turn around and watch your foes feel the aftermath.*

| **Area, Charge, Psionic, Telekinesis** |               **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 5 x 2 line within 1**             | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** You teleport to a square on the opposite side of the area before making the power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 12 sonic damage
- **12-16:** 18 sonic damage
- **17+:** 24 sonic damage

**Strained:** If you obtain a tier 2 outcome or better, you are slowed until the end of your turn and each target is slowed until the end of their turn.

###### Mind Snare (9 Clarity)

*You latch onto your prey's brain and don't let go, like a song they can't get out of their head.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                       | **üéØ One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 10 + R psychic damage; R < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 + R psychic damage; R < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 + R psychic damage; R < STRONG, slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** While slowed this way, the target takes 3 psychic damage for each square they willingly leave.

**Strained:** While slowed this way, the target instead takes 5 psychic damage for each square they willingly leave. You have a double bane on ability rolls made against the target while they are slowed this way.

###### Soulbound (9 Clarity)

*You fire a piercing bolt of psychic energy that lances through two foes and leaves a faint intangible thread between them.*

| **Animapathy, Psionic, Ranged, Strike** |    **Main action** |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                        | **üéØ Two enemies** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **‚â§11:** 8 damage; A < WEAK, the target is stitched to the other target (save ends)
- **12-16:** 13 damage; A < AVERAGE, the target is stitched to the other target (save ends)
- **17+:** 17 damage; A < STRONG, the target is stitched to the other target (save ends)

**Effect:** If any target becomes stitched to the other, both targets are stitched together. While stitched together, a target takes a bane on power rolls while not adjacent to a creature they're stitched to. Whenever a stitched target takes damage that wasn't dealt by or also taken by another stitched target, each other stitched target takes half the damage the initial target took.

**Strained:** You target yourself and three enemies instead.
