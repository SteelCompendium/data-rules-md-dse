### Stormwight Kits

The stormwight primordial aspect lets you channel your ferocity into the form of an animal and grants you knowledge of one stormwight kit of your choice. You can master additional stormwight kits through play, changing them out during a respite as with any other kit (see Chapter 6: Kits).

#### Kit Features

All stormwight kits have the following features in common.

##### Aspect Benefits and Animal Form

Your primordial aspect benefits are always available to you, and you gain additional benefits while in the animal or hybrid form granted by your stormwight kit.

##### Aspect of the Wild

You have the following ability.

###### Aspect of the Wild

*You assume the form of the animal who channels your ferocity.*

| **Magic**   | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **üìè Self** |  **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** You can shapeshift into the animal defined by your stormwight kit, into a hybrid form, or back into your true form. While in animal form or hybrid form, you can speak as you usually do, and you can also speak to animals who share your form. If you are in a negotiation with an animal while in animal form, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual.

**Spend 1 Ferocity:** As a free maneuver, you can shapeshift a second time, either into another animal form, into your hybrid form, or back into your true form.

##### Primordial Storm

Each stormwight kit is associated with a primordial storm, which channels a specific damage type used by some of your abilities.

##### Equipment

You wear no armor and wield only your unarmed strikes-which become devastating natural weapons as your ferocity grows.

These bonuses apply in your true form, your animal form, and your hybrid form. See Chapter 6: Kits for information on kit bonuses.
