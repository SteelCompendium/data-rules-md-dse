### 2nd-Level Aspect Ability

Your primordial aspect grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

##### 2nd-Level Berserker Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

###### Special Delivery (5 Ferocity)

*You ready?*

| **📏 Melee 1**    | **🎯 One willing ally** |

**Effect:** You vertically push the target up to 4 squares. This forced movement ignores the target's stability, and the target takes no damage from colliding with creatures or objects. At the end of this movement, the target can make a free strike that deals extra damage equal to your Might score.

###### Wrecking Ball (5 Ferocity)

*It's easier to destroy than to create. Much easier, in fact!*

| **📏 Self; see below** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** You move up to your speed in a straight line. During this movement, you can move through mundane structures, including walls, which are difficult terrain for you. You automatically destroy each square of structure you move through and leave behind a square of difficult terrain.

Additionally, you make one power roll that targets each enemy you move adjacent to during this movement.

**Power Roll + Might:**
