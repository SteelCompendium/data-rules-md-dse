### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Chaos Incarnate

Your mastery of elemental forces protects and emboldens you. If you are a berserker or reaver, you have immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, and sonic damage equal to twice your Might score. If you are a stormwight, your damage immunity from your Primordial Storm feature (see Stormwight Kits) increases to three times your Might score.

When any elemental or any other creature whose abilities deal acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have P < STRONG, they are frightened of you (save ends).

Additionally, when you use Primordial Strike, you can spend up to 3 ferocity, gaining 1 surge per ferocity spent to use for that strike.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Might and Agility scores each increase to 5.

#### Growing Ferocity Improvement

Your Growing Ferocity feature provides additional benefits when you have 12 or more ferocity.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, exploration, or intrigue perk of your choice.

#### Primordial Ferocity

The first time you take damage each combat round, you gain 3 ferocity instead of 2.

#### Primordial Power

You have an epic resource called primordial power. Each time you finish a respite, you gain primordial power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend primordial power on your abilities as if it were ferocity.

Additionally, you can spend any amount of primordial power as a free maneuver, ending one effect on you for each primordial power spent.

You can also spend 3 primordial power to create a portal to Quintessence without needing a source of elemental power.

Primordial power remains until you spend it.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
