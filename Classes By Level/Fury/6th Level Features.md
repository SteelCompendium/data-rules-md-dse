### 6th-Level Features

As a 6th-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Marauder of the Primordial Chaos

As your connection to the power of the Primordial Chaos grows ever stronger, you automatically sense any elemental creatures or magic sources of elemental power, such as a lava pool or a lake overlapping with Quintessence, within 1 mile of you.

Additionally, you can speak with elemental creatures, and when you are in a negotiation with an elemental, you treat your Renown as 1 higher than usual. This stacks with the increase to your effective Renown provided by the Nature's Knight aspect feature (see 3rd-Level Features). When any elemental first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have P < AVERAGE, they are frightened of you (save ends).

#### Primordial Portal

As a main action, you can touch a magic source of elemental power and use it to create a portal to Quintessence. You can then use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you through the portal and onto a safe island in Quintessence, or to teleport back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might score, each leading to the same safe island in Quintessence. If a portal in your network is destroyed, it is no longer part of the network. You can remove a portal from your network no matter your distance from it, including across different worlds (no action required).

(Exploring Quintessence is possible from your island, but continued safety is not guaranteed.)

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, exploration, or intrigue perk of your choice.

Your primordial aspect grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.
