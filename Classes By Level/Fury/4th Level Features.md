### 4th-Level Features

As a 4th-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Might and Agility scores each increase to 3.

#### Damaging Ferocity

The first time you take damage each combat round, you gain 2 ferocity instead of 1.

#### Growing Ferocity Improvement

Your Growing Ferocity feature provides additional benefits when you have 8 or more ferocity.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Primordial Attunement

As your ferocity manifests elemental forces created by the Primordial Chaos, you are aware of how elemental power interacts with those around you. You automatically sense whether any creature within 10 squares has damage immunity or damage weakness to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage, learning whether they have immunity or weakness, the value of that immunity or weakness, and the specific damage type. Additionally, you automatically sense any source of one of those damage types within 10 squares, such as a fire or a source of elemental power.

#### Primordial Strike

You can manifest your ferocity directly as an elemental force created by the Primordial Chaos. As part of any strike, you can spend 1 ferocity to gain 1 surge that must be used for that strike. The extra damage dealt by the surge can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic (your choice).

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice. See Skills in Chapter 9: Tests.
