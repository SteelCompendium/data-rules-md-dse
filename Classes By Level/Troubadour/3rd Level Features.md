### 3rd-Level Features

As a 3rd-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### 3rd-Level Class Act Feature

Your troubadour class act grants you a feature, as shown on the 3rd-Level Class Act Features table.

###### 3rd-Level Class Act Features Table

| Class Act | Features     |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Auteur    | Missed Cue   |
| Duelist   | Foil         |
| Virtuoso  | Second Album |

##### Foil

At the start of an encounter, choose one creature within your line of effect. You have a double edge on power rolls made against or in competition with that creature. The chosen creature also has a double edge on power rolls made against or in competition with you. If the chosen creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can choose a new foil at the start of the next combat round.

##### Missed Cue

If you aren't surprised at the start of an encounter, you can choose one enemy within your line of effect who is not a leader or solo creature. The Director temporarily removes the chosen creature from the encounter. The chosen creature enters the encounter at the start of the second combat round. You must earn 3 Victories before you can use this feature again.

##### Second Album

You have the following performance abilities, which are usable with your Routines feature.

###### "Fire Up the Night"

*Maybe you and I ♪ We can still bring the light!♪*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area doesn't take a bane on strikes against creatures with concealment. Once during their turn, they can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests).

###### "Never-Ending Hero"

*And toniiight we can truly say ♪ They will alllways find a way!♪*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn dying while in the area gains an edge on power rolls and ignores the effects of bleeding until the end of their turn.

#### 7-Drama Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 7 drama to use.

###### Extensive Rewrites (7 Drama)

*No, this isn't right. That foe was over there!*

| **Area, Magic** |                 **No action** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 4 burst**  | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** Slide 3; P < WEAK, this slide ignores the target's stability
- **12-16:** Slide 5; P < AVERAGE, this slide ignores the target's stability
- **17+:** Slide 7; P < STRONG, this slide ignores the target's stability

**Effect:** Instead of sliding a target, you can swap their location with another target as long as each can fit into the other's space. You can't slide targets into other creatures or objects using this ability.

###### Infernal Gavotte (7 Drama)

*A spicy performance lights a fire under your allies' feet.*

| **Area, Magic, Melee, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**                 | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 5 fire damage; A < WEAK, weakened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 7 fire damage; A < AVERAGE, weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 10 fire damage; A < STRONG, weakened (save ends)

**Effect:** Each ally in the area can shift up to 2 squares.

###### Star Solo (7 Drama)

*Your performance travels and doesn't stop moving until your audience is completely rocked.*

| **Magic, Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 10**              | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 5 + P damage
- **12-16:** 8 + P damage; push 3
- **17+:** 11 + P damage; push 5

**Effect:** You can choose to have this ability deal sonic damage. Additionally, you can use this ability against the same target for the next 2 combat rounds without spending drama.

###### We Meet at Last (7 Drama)

*You magically intertwine your fate with another creature-for better or worse.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |        **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One creature** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, both you and the target can target each other with abilities even if you are beyond distance, with the distance of this ability replacing those abilities' distances. The target can't be force moved by an ability used beyond distance this way.

Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either granting them 2 surges or forcing them to take a bane on the next ability roll they make before the start of your next turn.
