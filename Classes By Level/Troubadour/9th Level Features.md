### 9th-Level Features

As a 9th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Roar of the Crowd

You are empowered by your audience, near and far. You can't be made frightened, and if you are prone, you can stand up as a free maneuver.

Additionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to invoke the roar of an invisible applauding audience. You and each ally within 3 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 10 + the number of active bonds from your Scene Partner feature + either your Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher).

#### 9th-Level Class Act Ability

Your troubadour class act grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.
