### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Applause

You have an epic resource called applause. Each time you finish a respite, you gain applause equal to the XP you gain. You can spend applause on your abilities as if it were drama.

Additionally, whenever you or a creature within 3 squares would obtain a failure or a tier 1 outcome on a test, you can spend 1 applause to improve the outcome by 1 tier.

Applause remains until you spend it.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility and Presence scores each increase to 5.

#### Dramaturgy

You gain 1 additional drama or other Heroic Resource whenever you use your Appeal to the Muses feature. Additionally, your performances no longer have a distance, but can affect any target on the encounter map within your line of effect.

#### Greatest of All Time

Whenever you obtain a success on a test, each NPC within your line of effect has their Impression score decreased by 4 during a negotiation (to a minimum of 1), and each ally within 3 squares of you gains an edge on their next test. These effects last until you start your next respite.

#### Perk

You gain one interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
