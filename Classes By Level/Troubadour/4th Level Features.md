### 4th-Level Features

As a 4th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Agility and Presence scores each increase to 3.

#### Melodrama

You have more ways of getting the most drama out of a situation. Choose two of the following events to add to the events that grant you drama during battle:

- Whenever a creature rolls a natural 2 on a power roll, you gain 2 drama.
- The first time the Director deals damage to a hero using a Villain action or an ability that costs Malice, you gain 2 drama.
- The first time a hero unwillingly falls 5 or more squares, you gain 2 drama.
- The first time a hero deals damage with 3 surges, you gain 2 drama.
- Whenever a hero spends their last Recovery, you gain 2 drama.

Alternatively, you can forgo choosing a new event to choose one event you already have (including an event gained with this feature). Whenever the chosen event grants you drama, you gain 1 additional drama.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice. See Skills in Chapter 9: Tests.

#### Zeitgeist

You always have your ear to the ground, your finger on the pulse. When you start or finish a respite, choose one of the following effects.

##### Foreshadowing

You can ask the Director for two clues regarding an upcoming encounter or negotiation. One of the clues can be false.

##### Hear Ye, Hear Ye!

By bragging, intimidating, leading, or lying, you attempt to spread one piece of information into the local area. Make a Presence test:

- **â‰¤11:** Your information reaches no one.
- **12-16:** Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town size or larger. You and each ally present when you make the test gain an edge on Presence tests in that area until one of you spends a Recovery.
- **17+:** Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town size or larger, plus the next closest such population. You and allies present for your test gain an edge on Presence tests made in those areas until you start your next respite.

##### Latest Goss

You can ask the Director for three rumors regarding the area you're in or an area you plan on entering before your next respite. One of the rumors can be false.
