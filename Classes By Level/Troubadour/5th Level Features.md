### 5th-Level Features

As a 5th-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

#### 5th-Level Class Act Feature

Your troubadour class act grants your choice of one of two features.

##### Auteur Features

Choose one of the following features.

###### Fix It in Post

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: bleeding, frightened, prone, slowed, or taunted. You change that condition to another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the original condition. A target who is no longer prone can stand up.

###### Take Two!

You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your Routines feature.

> **Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area can reroll the first power roll that turn that obtains a tier 2 outcome. They must use the new roll.

##### Duelist Features

Choose one of the following features.

###### Verbal Duel

Once on each of your turns while the target of your Foil feature is adjacent to you, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with them. Make an opposed Presence test with the target. Whoever gets the higher result can make a free strike, which deals psychic damage instead of its usual damage.

###### We Can't Be Upstaged!

You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your Routines feature.

##### Virtuoso Features

Choose one of the following features.

###### Bolstering Banter

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with a target of your current performance, other than yourself. The target can spend a Recovery to gain temporary Stamina equal to their recovery value.

###### Medley

You can maintain two performances at a time using your Routines feature.

#### 9-Drama Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 drama to use.

<!-- -->
> ###### Action Hero (9 Drama)
>
> *You wield your weapon at blistering speed, leaving everyone around you fighting for their lives.*
>
> | **Area, Melee, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
> | ----------------------- | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 3 burst**          | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |
>
> **Power Roll + Agility:**
>
> - **≤11:** 10 damage
> - **12-16:** 14 damage
> - **17+:** 20 damage
>
> **Effect:** Unless you score a critical hit, this ability can't reduce a non-minion target below 1 Stamina.

<!-- -->
> ###### Continuity Error (9 Drama)
>
> *Your subject is written into two places at once.*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |               **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | -------------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One enemy or object** |
>
> **Effect:** The target is split into two separate entities, one of which remains in the target's space while the other appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within distance. If the target is a creature, this creates a new creature under the Director's control. Each entity has half the original target's Stamina, is weakened, and takes 1d6 corruption damage at the start of each of their turns. If either entity is reduced to 0 Stamina, the other entity persists as the original entity and this effect ends. The effect also ends if both entities occupy the same space, causing them to automatically merge and combine their current Stamina.

<!-- -->
> ###### Love Song (9 Drama)
>
> *You play a small ditty that plants you inside your target's heart.*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |                  **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One creature or object** |
>
> **Effect:** The target gains 20 temporary Stamina. Until the end of the encounter, whenever the target takes damage while you're within distance, you can choose to take the damage instead of the target.

<!-- -->
> ###### Patter Song (9 Drama)
>
> *Dazzle them with your fancy patter and they forget where they were.*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | -------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Power Roll + Presence:**
>
> - **≤11:** One ally within distance can take their turn immediately after yours.
> - **12-16:** Two allies within distance can take their turns immediately after yours in any order.
> - **17+:** Three allies within distance can take their turns immediately after yours in any order. One of those allies can have already taken a turn this combat round.
