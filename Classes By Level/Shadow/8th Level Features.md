### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level shadow, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level College Feature

Your shadow college grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level College Features table.

###### 8th-Level College Features Table

| College         | Feature     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Black Ash       | Cinder Step |
| Caustic Alchemy | Time Bomb   |
| Harlequin Mask  | Parkour     |

##### Cinder Step

Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport. When you teleport this way, it counts as using a shadow ability for the purpose of using your Burning Ash and Trail of Cinders features.

##### Parkour

Your movement no longer provokes opportunity attacks. Additionally, you can use your Harlequin Gambit feature as a free triggered action when a creature is reduced to 0 Stamina by your Clever Trick ability.

##### Time Bomb

You have damage immunity against area abilities and effects equal to your Agility score. You also have the following ability, which you can use once per round on your turn.

###### Time Bomb

*The longer it cooks, the bigger the boom.*

**Effect:** Each target takes acid, fire, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your Agility score.

For each combat round that has passed since this ability was last used in the current encounter, the area increases by 1 and you gain 1 surge that must be used with this ability. After using the ability or at the end of the encounter, its area and surges are reset.

**Spend 2+ Insight:** For every 2 insight spent, you increase the cube's size by 1 and gain 1 surge that can be used only with this ability.
