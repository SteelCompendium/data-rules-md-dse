### 5th-Level Features

#### 5th-Level College Feature

Your shadow college grants you a feature, as shown on the 5th-Level College Features table.

###### 5th-Level College Features Table

| College         | Feature           |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Black Ash       | Trail of Cinders  |
| Caustic Alchemy | Volatile Reagents |
| Harlequin Mask  | Harlequin Gambit  |

##### Harlequin Gambit

Whenever you reduce an adjacent non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your I'm No Threat ability and then move up to your speed.

If the creature is the same size as you, you can disguise yourself as them using I'm No Threat without spending insight. If you do, while I'm No Threat is active, the creature's body is disguised to look like your body. The illusion ends on their body if another creature physically interacts with it. When the illusion would end for either you or the creature's body, it ends for both.

##### Trail of Cinders

Whenever you reduce a non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your Black Ash Teleport ability.

Additionally, you can now bring an adjacent willing creature along with you whenever you use a shadow ability to teleport. The creature appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the space into which you teleported. If no such space exists, they can't teleport with you.

##### Volatile Reagents

Whenever you take damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire, acid, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your Agility score.

Additionally, your Defensive Roll ability now allows you to shift up to 5 squares, including shifting vertically. If you don't end this shift on solid ground and are not flying, you fall.

#### 9-Insight Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 insight to use.

###### Blackout (9 Insight)

*You cause a plume of shadow to erupt from your eyes and create a cloud of darkness.*

| **Area, Magic** |   **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**  | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** A black cloud fills the area until the end of your next turn, granting you and your allies concealment against enemies. While you are in the area, whenever an enemy ends their turn in the area, you can use a free triggered action to shift to a new location within the area and make a free strike against them.

###### Into the Shadows (9 Insight)

*You sweep your foe off their feet and plunge them into absolute darkness.*

| **Magic, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                   | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Effect:** You and the target are removed from the encounter map until the start of your next turn. You reappear in the spaces you left or the nearest unoccupied spaces. Make a power roll upon your return.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 8 + A corruption damage
- **12-16:** 13 + A corruption damage
- **17+:** 17 + A corruption damage

###### Shadowfall (9 Insight)

*You vanish. They fall. You reappear.*

| **Area, Melee, Weapon**     |               **Main action** |

- **17+:** 20 damage

**Effect:** You disappear before making the power roll. After the power roll is resolved, you appear in the first unoccupied space at the far end of the line.

###### You Talk Too Much (9 Insight)

*Silence is a virtue. A knife pinning their mouth shut is the next best thing.*

| **Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 5**        | **🎯 One creature** |
