### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities bolster your body and grant the power to permanently create and shape physical terrain.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities devastate enemies and melt objects to slag.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of decay. Rot abilities harm and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the mystery. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance your allies' power, and alter your enemies' power for the worse.

You choose an elemental specialization from the following options: earth, fire, green, or void. Your elemental specialization is your subclass, and your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels, including one of the following benefits. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) (*Quick Build:* Fire.)

##### Earth: Acolyte of Earth

You harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an ability that has the Earth and Magic keywords, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.

##### Fire: Acolyte of Fire

You become an expert at wielding destructive flames. Your abilities that have the Fire and Magic keywords gain a +1 bonus to rolled damage. Your Hurl Element ability (see below) also gains this bonus when you use it to deal fire damage.

##### Green: Acolyte of the Green

You harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures using an ability that has the Green and Magic keywords and that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.

##### Void: Acolyte of the Mystery

You use your immersion in the mystery of void magic to expand the reach of that magic better than other mages. The distance of all your abilities that have the Magic, Ranged, and Void keywords increases by 2 squares.

#### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

##### Essence in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain 1 essence.

You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

##### Essence Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence equal to your Victories.

#### Hurl Element

You have the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

###### Hurl Element

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at a foe.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**          | **üéØ One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 2 + R damage
- **12-16:** 4 + R damage
- **17+:** 6 + R damage

**Effect:** When you make this strike, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

#### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.

#### Practical Magic

You have the following ability.

###### Practical Magic

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

| **Magic**              | **Maneuver** |
| ---------------------- | -----------: |
| **üìè Self; see below** |  **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.
- You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If you choose this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional square for each essence spent.

#### 1st-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

#### 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earth          | Motivate Earth             |
| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |
| Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

##### A Beyonding of Vision

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. Additionally, you always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability.

###### Shared Void Sense

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**        | **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void Sense ability.

##### It Is the Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

##### Motivate Earth

You have the following ability.

###### Motivate Earth

*The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command.*

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it. You can instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

##### Return to Formlessness

You have the following ability.

###### Return to Formlessness

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

| **Fire, Magic, Melee** |           **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**         | **üéØ One mundane object** |

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to melt or combust, destroying it. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object you touch is destroyed.

#### Specialization Triggered Action

Your elemental specialization grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Specialization Triggered Actions table.

**Effect:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score.

**Spend 1 Essence:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to twice your Reason score instead.

**Effect:** Mushrooms cover the target's body. While the mushrooms are on the target, you and any ally adjacent to the target gain 1 surge whenever the target takes damage. The mushrooms can be removed by the target or an adjacent creature as a main action.

###### Ripples in the Earth (3 Essence)

*Like a stone was dropped into a pond, waves in the earth radiate from you.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 2 burst**         | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 3 damage
- **12-16:** 5 damage
- **17+:** 8 damage; M < STRONG, prone

**Effect:** You must be touching the ground to use this ability. Additionally, you can choose a square of ground in the area that is unoccupied or is occupied by you or any ally. A pillar of earth rises out of the ground in that square, with a height in squares up to your Reason score. The pillar can't collide with any creatures or objects, nor can it force creatures raised by it to collide with other creatures or objects.

###### 5-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 5 essence to use. (*Quick Build:* Conflagration.)

###### Conflagration (5 Essence)

*A storm of fire descends upon your enemies.*

| **Area, Fire, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 3 cube within 10**       | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 4 fire damage
- **12-16:** 6 fire damage
- **17+:** 10 fire damage

**Persistent 2:** At the start of your turn, you can use a maneuver to use this ability again without spending essence.

###### Instantaneous Excavation (5 Essence)

*The surface of the world around you opens up to swallow foes.*

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------ | -------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         | **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** You open up two holes with 1-square openings that are 4 squares deep, which can be placed on any mundane surface within distance. You can place these holes next to each other to create fewer holes with wider openings. When the holes open, make a separate power roll for each creature on the ground above a hole and small enough to fall in. (You can't score a critical hit with this ability because it uses a maneuver.)

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** The target can shift 1 square from the edge of the hole to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice.
- **12-16:** The target falls into the hole.
- **17+:** The target falls into the hole and can't reduce the height of the fall.

**Persistent 1:** At the start of your turn, you open another hole, making a power roll against each creature who could fall into the hole when it opens without spending essence.

###### No More Than a Breeze (5 Essence)

*The material substance of a creature shreds away at your command.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |            **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**        | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target can move through solid matter, they ignore difficult terrain, and their movement can't provoke opportunity attacks. If the target ends their turn inside solid matter, they are forced out into the space where they entered it and this effect ends.

**Persistent 1:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

###### Test of Rain (5 Essence)

*You call down a rain that burns your enemies and restores your allies.*

| **Area, Green, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 3 cube within 10**        | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 4 acid damage
- **12-16:** 6 acid damage
- **17+:** 10 acid damage

**Effect:** You can end one effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Each ally in the area also gains this benefit.
