### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
| Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
| Void           | There Is No Space Between |

##### Disciple of Earth

Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, and you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level past 2nd.

##### Disciple of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can make that damage fire damage.

##### Disciple of the Green

You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T animal who fits the rodent type. When you take on an animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls undamaged to the ground (your choice). When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. When you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

##### There Is No Space Between

You have the following ability.

###### There Is No Space Between

*Knowledge of the mystery reveals that two spaces are the same space.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces within distance, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.

#### New 5-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 5 essence to use. Alternatively, you can choose one of the 5-essence abilities you didn't select at 1st level (see 1st-Level Features).

###### O Flower Aid, O Earth Defend (5 Essence)

*Revitalizing plants and jagged stones grow, helping allies and hindering foes.*

| **Area, Earth, Green, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 3 cube within 10**               | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the area gains the following effects:

- Once as a free maneuver at the start of your turn, you allow yourself and each ally in the area to spend any number of Recoveries.
- The area is difficult terrain for enemies.
- Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes damage equal to your Reason score.

**Persistent 1:** The area remains until the start of your next turn. As a maneuver, you can move the area up to 5 squares. This ability ends if the area is ever not within your line of effect.

###### Subvert the Green Within (5 Essence)

*Fungal spores sprout inside your enemy's brain, allowing you to control their actions.*

| **Green, Magic, Ranged, Strike, Void** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Effect:** The target uses their signature ability against a creature of your choice. This signature ability can target the creature even if it usually wouldn't. You then make a power roll against the target of this ability.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 5 + R poison damage
- **12-16:** 9 + R poison damage
- **17+:** 12 + R poison damage

###### Translated Through Flame (5 Essence)

*Your ally disappears, then reappears in a burst of fire.*

| **Fire, Magic, Ranged, Void** |         **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**              | **🎯 Self or one ally** |
