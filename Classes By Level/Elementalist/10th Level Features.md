### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Breath

You have an epic resource called breath. Each time you finish a respite, you gain breath equal to the XP you gain. You can spend any number of breath to gain essence (no action required). When you do, 1 breath becomes 3 essence.

Breath remains until you convert it to essence.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Reason score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.

#### Essential Being

When you gain essence at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 essence instead of 3.

#### One

You become the embodiment of the element of your chosen specialization. Whenever you use magic, elemental motes flit around you and your skin changes to reflect your element, taking on an earthen or stony appearance for earth, appearing like flickering flame for fire, gaining a leaf pattern for green, and becoming a starry expanse for void. Additionally, you gain one of the following benefits, as shown on the One Specialization Features table.

###### One Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Earth          | Master of Earth |
| Fire           | Master of Fire  |
| Green          | Master of Green |
| Void           | Master of Void  |

##### Master of Earth

You have damage immunity 5.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains, level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.

##### Master of Fire

The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and applies to all your magic abilities.

Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.

##### Master of Green

The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.

As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for the longest time.

##### Master of Void

Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport.

Additionally, your mind is connected to the mystery and helps you find the answers you seek. You no longer require project sources for research projects. Whenever you use a respite activity to make a project roll for a research project, you automatically complete the project.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
