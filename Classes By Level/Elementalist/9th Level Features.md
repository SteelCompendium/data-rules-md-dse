### 9th-Level Features

As a 9th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Grand Wyrding

You have mastered the magic of shaping a wyrd, and can use your Wyrding feature as a main action.

Additionally, when you have 5 or more Victories, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. You have immunity all to that type.

#### New 11-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 essence to use. Alternatively, you can choose one of the 11-essence abilities you didn't select at 8th level (see 8th-Level Features).

While the shield is active, the target can take the Defend main action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains 30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or until the effect ends. If this temporary Stamina disappears, the effect ends and the shield explodes, dealing 10 damage to each enemy within 5 squares of the target.
