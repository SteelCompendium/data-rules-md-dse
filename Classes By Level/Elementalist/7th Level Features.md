### 7th-Level Features

As a 7th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Characteristic Increase

Each of your characteristic scores increases by 1, to a maximum of 4.

#### Mantle of Quintessence

Your Mantle of Essence feature no longer requires essence.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence now radiates magic that creates a calming air. Creatures in the area of the mantle's aura have their starting patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5) during any negotiation. While in the area, you and any ally gain an edge on tests that use the Handle Animals skill. If you have 5 or more Victories, the bonus to patience increases to 2 and tests that use the Handle Animals skill have a double edge.

#### Surging Essence

When you gain essence at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 3 essence instead of 2.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
