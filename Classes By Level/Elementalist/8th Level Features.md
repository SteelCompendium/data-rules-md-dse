### 8th-Level Features

As an 8th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one perk of your choice.

#### 8th-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 8th-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Earth          | Summon Source of Earth |
| Fire           | The Flame Primordial   |
| Green          | Chimeric Manifestation |
| Void           | Black Hole Star        |

##### Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced movement ignores stability for your allies.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal to your level.

##### Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).

##### The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return to Formlessness ability instead.

Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is wearing mostly metal.

##### Summon Source of Earth

You have the following ability.

###### Summon Source of Earth

*The ground rumbles as an elemental bursts forth, ready to serve.*

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** | **Main action** |
| ------------------------ | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance. The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is dismissed at the start of your next turn.

The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you can't use this ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.

**Persistent 2:** The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of your next turn.

###### Source of Earth Statblock

#### 11-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 essence to use.

###### Heart of the Wode (11 Essence)

*You call forth one of the Great Tree's many splinters to provide for your every need.*

| **Green, Magic, Ranged** | **Main action** |
| ------------------------ | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has 100 Stamina and can't be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree to use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when you start your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn, or you can stand up if you are prone. Each ally within distance also gains this benefit.

Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained until the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a main action to end the effect early.

###### Muse of Fire (11 Essence)

*The fire burns hot enough to sear the face of any god watching.*

| **Area, Fire, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 5 cube within 10**       | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 7 fire damage; the Director loses 2 Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*)
- **12-16:** 10 fire damage; the Director loses 3 Malice
- **17+:** 15 fire damage; the Director loses 4 Malice

**Effect:** The Director's Malice can become negative as a result of this ability.

###### Return to Oblivion (11 Essence)

*You create a tear in reality that could consume everything.*

| **Area, Magic, Ranged, Void** | **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**              |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** You create a size 1L vortex that lasts until the end of the encounter. At the start of each combat round while the vortex is unoccupied, the vortex vertical pulls 3 each enemy within 5 squares of it. Each enemy who enters the vortex or starts their turn there is knocked prone. At the end of the round, if a winded enemy who is not a leader or solo creature is in the vortex, they are instantly destroyed.

###### World Torn Asunder (11 Essence)

*You stomp your foot and quake the whole world over.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 5 burst**         | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** M < WEAK, prone
- **12-16:** M < AVERAGE, prone
- **17+:** M < STRONG, prone

**Effect:** You create a fissure in the ground adjacent to you that is a 10 x 2 line and 6 squares deep. Each creature in the area who is prone and size 2 or smaller falls in. Other creatures can enter the fissure or can shift to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice outside it.
