### 6th-Level Features

As a 6th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Wyrding

You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a freeform magic spell for a variety of situations. Choose one of the following magical effects:

- You create a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason score or smaller.
- You construct a place of shelter suitable for twenty creatures that lasts for 24 hours and can't be detected by enemies.
- You restore all Stamina to a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason score or smaller.
- Choose a cube with a size up to your Reason score within 5 squares. You can fill that area with difficult terrain or natural phenomena such as fire, water, or plant life, or can clear the area of those things.
- You can preserve a corpse or up to 5 pounds of food for a week, or can cause a corpse or that amount of food to instantly rot.
- You create a seal on a surface that can't be seen or felt by anyone but you. When a creature comes adjacent to the surface, you can see and hear through the seal for as long as the creature remains adjacent to it. When you create the seal, you can decide to limit the number of creatures who activate it by choosing a creature keyword (such as Undead) or a specific name (such as Ajax the Invincible) or organization (such as the Black Iron Pact). If you do, the seal alerts you only when creatures with the keyword, name, or organizational affiliation you provide pass by it. If you create a second seal, the first one disappears. You can dispel a seal at any time (no action required).

#### New 9-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 9 essence to use. Alternatively, you can choose one of the 9-assence abilities you didn't select at 5th level (see 5th-Level Features).

###### Luminous Champion Aloft (9 Essence)

*They shine vibrantly, a beautiful diamond in the night sky.*

| **Fire, Green, Magic, Ranged, Void** |            **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                     | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target has a +3 bonus to speed, they can fly, and their abilities ignore concealment. Additionally, whenever the target gains their Heroic Resource, they gain 1 additional Heroic Resource. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

**Persistent 1:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

###### Magma Titan (9 Essence)

*Their body swells with lava, mud, and might, towering over their enemies.*

| **Earth, Fire, Green, Magic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                      | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following benefits:

- Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target becoming size 3. Each creature who is within the target's new space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability. If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until the effect ends.
- They have fire immunity 10.
- Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.
- When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement distance gains a +2 bonus.
- They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might power rolls.

**Persistent 2:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the start of your turn, the target can spend 2 Recoveries.

###### Meteor (9 Essence)

*You teleport the target into the air and let the ground and the elemental force of fire do the rest.*

| **Earth, Fire, Magic, Ranged, Void** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**                     | **üéØ One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** You teleport the target up to 4 squares.
- **12-16:** You teleport the target up to 6 squares.
- **17+:** You teleport the target up to 8 squares.

**Effect:** If the target is teleported to a space where they would fall, they immediately do so, treating the fall as if their Agility score were 0. The target takes fire damage from the fall, and each enemy within 3 squares of where they land takes the same amount of fire damage. The ground within 3 squares of where the target lands is difficult terrain.

###### The Wode Remembers and Returns (9 Essence)

*You create a terrarium that spans from canopy above to underbrush below.*

| **Area, Earth, Green, Magic, Void** | **Main action** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------: |
| **üìè 4 burst**                      |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** The area becomes dark and verdant, with trees and plant life appearing in unoccupied spaces within it until the start of your next turn. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and any ally who ends their turn in the area has cover.

**Persistent 2:** The area remains until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the start of your turn, each ally in the area can spend a Recovery.
