#### War Dog Collar

You wear a loyalty collar from one of Ajax's war dogs (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*). You've managed to rig the collar so it explodes outward while keeping you safe.

**Benefit:** Even if you are a war dog yourself, other war dogs can't use their Posthumous Promotion ability on you while you wear your collar. Additionally, you have the following ability.

###### Posthumous Retirement

*You make your modified collar explode.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 1 burst**  | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Your loyalty collar detonates, dealing fire damage equal to 5 plus your level to each target. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you spend 1 uninterrupted minute out of combat resetting the collar.

**Drawback:** Each time you use your Posthumous Retirement ability, the Director can spend 3 Malice to make your collar malfunction and deal its damage to you in addition to the usual targets.
