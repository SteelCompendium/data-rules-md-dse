#### Ivory Tower

You studied in an academy or other educational institution. Your training was thorough and your reading list was wide-ranging. But when you left school, you discovered there were serious gaps in your education. Maybe some of those books were a little out of date.

**Benefit:** You have three skills of your choice, and you know one dead language of your choice (see [Languages in Orden](#page-70-0) in [Chapter 4: Background](#page-67-0)).

**Drawback:** The Director chooses one of the skills you have from this complication. You lose that skill and can't ever learn it again. Additionally, you take a bane on any test to which that skill would apply.
