#### Thrill Seeker

You live for danger. Whether in battle or mundane peril, you can transcend your usual limitsâ€”and once you've tasted that excitement, you want more.

**Benefit:** Each time your party reaches 2, 4, and 6 Victories, you earn the party a hero token.

**Drawback:** At the start of a new game session, the party doesn't earn a hero token for your character.
