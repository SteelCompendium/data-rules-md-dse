#### Cursed Weapon

When you were young, you found or were given a magic weapon. Since then, you've carried it always at your side, letting it inspire you to lead the life of a heroâ€”even though the weapon is cursed.

**Benefit:** You have a leveled weapon of your choice (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) in [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1)).

**Drawback:** You have damage weakness 2.
