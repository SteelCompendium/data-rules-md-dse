#### Prisoner of the Synlirii

You were captured by the psionic beings known as voiceless talkers (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*). You escaped them, but you can't escape a feeling that's lingered since then in the back of your mind-the feeling of being watched.

**Benefit:** You can telepathically communicate with any creature within 10 squares of you if they share a language with you and you know of each other. A creature you communicate with this way can respond telepathically if they choose.

**Drawback:** Any voiceless talker within 1 mile knows your location, and can overhear and understand your telepathic conversations.
