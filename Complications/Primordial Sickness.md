#### Primordial Sickness

You once contracted a terrible illness for which no one could find a cure. You sought out a primordial swamp said to be either cursed or miraculously salubrious. It turned out to be both, keeping your illness at bay while corrupting your body with its unnatural energy.

**Benefit:** You have corruption immunity 5 and poison immunity 5.

**Drawback:** Your number of Recoveries is permanently reduced by 1.
