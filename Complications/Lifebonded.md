#### Lifebonded

In a sinister ritual, your soul has been bound to that of another creature. This might be a companion, a creature you are beholden to, or an enemy. When they die, you dieâ€”making you the perfect bodyguard.

**Benefit:** Choose another creature who doesn't have the Lifebonded complication. When you die, your body disappears until that creature finishes a respite or earns 1 or more Victories. You then appear next to the creature, fully healed.

**Drawback:** If the creature you're bound to dies, you die as well, no matter what other traits or features you have.
