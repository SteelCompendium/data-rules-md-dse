#### Hunter

You are hunting someone or somethingâ€”perhaps a wanted criminal, a person who wronged you, or a dangerous monster or beast. You won't rest until you face off against your quarry!

**Benefit:** Choose one skill from the following:

- Interrogate (from the interpersonal skill group)
- Alertness, Eavesdrop, Search, or Track (from the intrigue skill group)
- Criminal Underworld, Rumors, or Society (from the lore skill group)

You have that skill, and you gain an edge on tests made to find or learn clues about your quarry.

**Drawback:** You are so obsessed with finding your quarry that you take a bane on any test made to track other creatures.
