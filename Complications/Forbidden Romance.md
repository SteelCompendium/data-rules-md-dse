#### Forbidden Romance

You are in love with someone powerful, but tragic circumstances mean you cannot be with them. Whether your lover is from a feuding family, betrothed to another, or has been driven from your side, you are fated to always be apart.

**Benefit:** You can secretly call on your betrothed for favors. Though they support you from afar, they might be constrained in how much aid they provideâ€”and they can't openly reveal their connection with you.

**Drawback:** When your lover is in trouble, they might call on you for help. But if your relationship is discovered, the circumstances that keep you apart will be made worse.
