#### Lost Your Head

A bredbeddle stole your head! Usually, being beheaded by one of those magical giants is fatal (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), but your latent psionic ability allows you to survive despite your decapitation.

**Benefit:** You have the following ability.

###### Share Head

*You don't have a head, but you can psionically borrow another.*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |                **Maneuver** |
| ------------------- | --------------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**    | **üéØ One willing creature** |

**Effect:** You can see, hear, and smell as if you were in the target's space. Additionally, you can borrow their mouth to speak when you wish to do so, speaking in your own voice. This effect ends when you use Share Head on a different target, when the target moves more than 10 squares away from you, or when the target is no longer willing to share their head with you.

**Drawback:** Having no head, you can't see, hear, smell, taste, or verbalize except by using the Share Head ability. Additionally, you can't wear gear that requires a head, such as a helmet or hat.
