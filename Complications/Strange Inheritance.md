#### Strange Inheritance

Your siblings each inherited money or land, but you received a strange, seemingly useless trinketâ€”along with the advice that maybe you weren't cut out for an ordinary, peaceful life.

**Benefit:** You have a somewhat inoperative 2nd-echelon trinket of the Director's choice (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) in [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1)). This trinket functions only while the total of your level plus your Victories is 5 or higher. You don't learn what the trinket's powers are until the first time it becomes operative.

**Drawback:** With no other inheritance, you accumulated debts. The first time your Wealth exceeds 1, you lose 1 Wealth.
