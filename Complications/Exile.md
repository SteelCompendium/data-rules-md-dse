#### Exile

Whether you're a convicted criminal, a noble stripped of their title, or a person who made one too many enemies, you've been cast forth from your homeland, never to return. At least not until you're strong enough to set things right.

**Benefit:** You know one extant language of your choice (see [Languages in Orden](#page-70-0) in [Chapter 4: Background](#page-67-0)).

**Drawback:** If any NPC from your homeland recognizes you, whether in your homeland or elsewhere, they attempt to harm you at the Director's discretion.
