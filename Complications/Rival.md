#### Rival

Whatever your accomplishments, you'll forever measure yourself against a former companion who always seemed to stay one step ahead of you.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your skills. That skill grants a +3 bonus to tests instead of +2.

**Drawback:** Your rival has similar statistics to yours, but always had one skill they excelled at, as determined by the Director. Intimidated by their prowess, you take a bane on tests using that skill.
