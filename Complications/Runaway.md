#### Runaway

To your embarrassment, no sinister omens attended your birth and your closet contains no skeletons. You're just an ordinary person raised in a hardworking family. You're expected to carry on the family business—but who can settle down to a boring job when adventure calls! That's why you ran away.

**Benefit:** You have one skill of your choice from the crafting skill group.

**Drawback:** Members of your extended family are looking for you, intending to drag you home—and you've never been able to stand up to them.
