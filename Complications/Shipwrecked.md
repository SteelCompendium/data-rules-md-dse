#### Shipwrecked

You are the sole survivor of a shipwreck that left you stranded on a remote and inhospitable island for years. Your struggle to survive there granted you insight into the natural world but distanced you from who you once were.

**Benefit:** You have two skills of your choice from the exploration skill group.

**Drawback:** You have forgotten one language you know of your choice.
