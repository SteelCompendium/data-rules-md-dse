#### Dragon Dreams

You sometimes have strange dreams of a raging inferno... a gleaming pile of treasure... of spreading your wings and taking flight. You haven't told anyone about these dreams, except for your one strange relative who seems to know more than they're letting on.

**Benefit:** Choose 2 ancestry points' worth of purchased dragon knight traits (see [Chapter 3: Ancestries](#page-35-0)). You can use these traits whenever you have 5 or more Victories.

**Drawback:** Whenever you are reduced to 0 Stamina, you explode with heat and fire. You and each creature within 5 squares of you takes fire damage equal to twice your level. You can't reduce this damage for yourself in any way.
