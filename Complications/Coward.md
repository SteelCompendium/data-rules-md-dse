#### Coward

Some call you a coward, just because you shriek and run when you encounter danger. Sure, you might not have the natural bravado of less-imaginative people. And sure, you're always imagining the many horrible ways you could die, but you're used to fear. When you run in terror, you run *toward* the enemy.

**Benefit:** While you are frightened, you can move toward the source of your fear.

**Drawback:** Whenever you make a saving throw to end the frightened condition, you roll a d10 twice and take the lower roll.
