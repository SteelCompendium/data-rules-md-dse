#### Mundane

You're hopelessly nonmagical. When you try to use magic abilities, or even when they're used on you, they never work right. Even magic devices seem to fizzle in your presence.

**Benefit:** You have immunity to corruption, holy, and psychic damage equal to your level.

**Drawback:** Whenever you carry more than three magic treasures, you take a bane on power rolls.
