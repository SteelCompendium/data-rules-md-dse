#### Amnesia

You have no memory of your past before the... incident. Hopefully, you'll regain your memory soon and find out what the incident was. In the meantime, you need friends so you won't be alone when your past catches up to you.

**Benefit:** You have a supernatural possessionâ€”a 1st-echelon trinket of your choice (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) in [Chapter 13: Rewards](#page-327-1)) that might have some connection with your former life.

**Drawback:** You take a bane on any test made to recall lore.
