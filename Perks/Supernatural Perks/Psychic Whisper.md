#### Psychic Whisper

You have the following ability.

###### Psychic Whisper

*You send a one-way telepathic message to a friend.*

| ------------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 One ally** |

**Effect:** As long as the target understands one or more languages, you send a telepathic message to them that takes 10 seconds or less to speak. The target knows who the message is from and can decide to ignore it and subsequent messages.
