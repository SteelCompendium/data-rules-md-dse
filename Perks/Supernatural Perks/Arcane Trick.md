#### Arcane Trick

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Arcane Trick
>
> *You cast an entertaining spell that creates a minor but impressive magical effect.*
>
> | **Magic**              | **Main action** |
> | ---------------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Self; see below** |     **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:
>
> - You teleport a size 1S or smaller object adjacent to you into an unoccupied space adjacent to you.
> - Until the start of your next turn, a part of your body shoots a shower of harmless noisy sparks that light up each square adjacent to you.
> - You ignite or snuff out (your choice) every mundane light source of 1L or smaller adjacent to you.
> - You transform up to 1 pound of edible food you touch to make it taste delicious or disgusting.
> - Until the start of your next turn, you make your body exude a particular odor you've smelled before. This smell can be sensed by each creature within 5 squares of you, but can't impose any condition or other drawback on those creatures.
> - You place a small magical inscription on the surface of a mundane object you touch, or you can remove an inscription that was made by you or by another creature using Arcane Trick.
> - You touch a size 1T object to cover it with an illusion that makes it look like a different object. Any creature who handles the object becomes aware of the illusion. The illusion ends when you stop touching the object.
