#### I've Read About This Place

Each time you enter a settlement you've never been to before, you can ask the Director one of the following questions:

- Who is the most influential public figure in this settlement?
- Who in this settlement would be the friendliest to us right now?
- What does this settlement need most from outsiders?

If the Director doesn't have an answer to the question you ask, or doesn't want to answer, you can instead ask a different question.
