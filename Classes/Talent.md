## Talent

Arare few people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, a significant event that activates a talent's abilities, can tap into the mind's full potential. You are one of those people—a master of psionics and a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. You can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind.

**As a talent, you are limited only by the strength of your mind. But the ability to wield multiple powers at once and change reality at will involves a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming you, and talents who use too much power too quickly pay a deadly price.**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Reason of 2 and a Presence of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- 2, −1, −1
- 1, 1, −1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason − 2

**Average Potency:** Reason − 1

**Strong Potency:** Reason

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Psionics and Read Person skills (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Empathize, Psionics, Read Person, Timescape.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level talent, you gain the following features.

#### Talent Tradition

Psionic abilities are grouped into categories according to their effects, with each category comprising one of many talent traditions:

- **Animapathy** abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.
- **Chronopathy** abilities allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
- **Cryokinesis** abilities allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to enemies and the environment alike.
- **Metamorphosis** abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.
- **Pyrokinesis** abilities allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
- **Resopathy** abilities allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.
- **Telekinesis** abilities allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.
- **Telepathy** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.

You choose a talent tradition from the following options: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. Your talent tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future products.) (*Quick Build:* Telekinesis.)

#### Clarity and Strain

The focus and precision of your thoughts grant you a Heroic Resource called clarity that empowers your psionic abilities.

##### Clarity in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature is force moved, you gain 1 clarity.

You can spend clarity you don't have, pushing that Heroic Resource into negative numbers to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each negative point of clarity.

Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of the encounter.

##### Clarity Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

Additionally, whenever you use any ability or effect that costs clarity within 1 minute of using another such ability, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effect from using the new ability. Whenever you use an ability with a strain effect outside of combat, you can take 1d6 damage and incur the effect if you don't incur it for other reasons.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity equal to your Victories.

#### Mind Spike

#### Psionic Augmentation

Through meditation, you create pathways in your mind that enhance your statistics. Choose one of the following augmentations. You can change your augmentation and ward (see Talent Ward below) by undergoing a psionic meditation as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Force Augmentation.)

##### Vanishing Ward

Your ward allows you to slip away from threats. Whenever you take damage, you become invisible until the end of your next turn.

#### Telepathic Speech

You know the Mindspeech language (see Languages in Orden in Chapter 4: Background). Additionally, you can telepathically communicate with any creatures within distance of your Mind Spike ability if they share a language with you and you know of each other. When you communicate with someone this way, they can respond telepathically.
