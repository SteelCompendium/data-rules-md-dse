## Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine power, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. Though the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

**As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, filling your enemies with awe and making you more worldly and aware.**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Intuition of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- 2, 2, −1, −1
- 2, 1, 1, −1
- 2, 1, 0, 0
- 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Intuition - 2

**Average Potency:** Intuition - 1

**Strong Potency:** Intuition

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** Choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). (*Quick Build:* Read Person, Religion.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

#### Deity and Domains

Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. The two domains you pick make up your subclass, and your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels. (*Quick Build:* Adûn for deity, and Life and Protection as domains.)

#### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety, letting you heal and empower your allies, and unleash holy power upon your foes.

##### Piety in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods—but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. Before you roll to gain piety at the start of your turn, you can pray (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).

You lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter.

##### Piety Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety equal to your Victories.

##### Domain Piety and Effects

Your choice of domains provides you with two additional ways to earn piety during combat, as triggered by specific events. You might even have a single event trigger both your piety effects. For example, the Sun domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes fire or holy damage, while the War domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes damage of 10 + your level or higher. If you have both those domains and a nearby creature takes an appropriate amount of fire damage, you gain piety from both your domains.

Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, you can choose one of your domains and have that domain's prayer effect take effect immediately.

###### Creation Domain Piety and Effect

- **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares uses an area ability.

###### Death Domain Piety and Effect

###### Knowledge Domain Piety and Effect

- **Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that the Director spends Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*).

Alternatively, you or one ally within 10 squares gains temporary Stamina equal to two times your Intuition score.

- **Prayer Effect:** One ally within 10 squares gains temporary Stamina equal to four times your Intuition score.

###### Storm Domain Piety and Effect

##### Blessing of Compassion

You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

##### Blessing of Comprehension

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. You are considered fluent in all languages for the purpose of understanding the project source for any research or crafting project (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects).

##### Blessing of Fortunate Weather

Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:

**Clear:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.

**Foggy:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill. **Overcast:** You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.

**Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.

If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.

##### Faithful Friend

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Faithful Friend
>
> *An animal spirit is drawn to you, sharing their senses with you and serving you faithfully.*
>
> | **Magic**   | **Main action** |
> | ----------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Self** |     **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.

##### Grave Speech

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Grave Speech
>
> *You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.*
>
> | **Magic**      |             **Maneuver** |
> | -------------- | -----------------------: |
> | **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 One dead creature** |
>
> **Effect:** You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

##### Hands of the Maker

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Hands of the Maker
>

##### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Inspired Deception

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Intuition on the test instead of another characteristic.

##### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

##### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

##### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level that lasts until you finish another respite.

##### Sanctified Weapon

As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Healing Grace

You have the following ability, which you can use once on your turn.

<!-- -->
> ###### Healing Grace

>
> | **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |

> | ----------------- | --------------: |

> **Trigger:** The target would take damage from an ability that uses a power roll.
>
> **Effect:** The power roll takes a bane against the target.
>
> **Spend 1 Piety:** The power roll has a double bane against the target.

#### Prayer

Your god answers a prayer with enhancements to your body and mind. Choose one of the following prayers. You can change your prayer along with your ward (see Conduit Ward below) by praying to your god as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Prayer of Distance.)

##### Prayer of Destruction

Your god infuses wrath within your being. You gain a +1 bonus to rolled damage with magic abilities.

##### Prayer of Distance

Your god blesses you with the ability to stretch your divine magic farther. You have a +2 bonus to the distance of your ranged magic abilities.

###### Improved Hands of the Maker

When you use your Hands of the Maker ability, you can create a mundane object that is size 2 or smaller.

###### Improved Sanctified Weapon

The weapon improved by your Sanctified Weapon feature grants a +3 bonus to rolled damage instead of +1.

###### Invocation of the Heart

As a main action, you forge a bond of love and friendship with a willing creature you touch.

###### Seance

You can commune with a network of spirits. As a respite activity, you speak the name of a creature who died and isn't undead. If the creature's spirit is free and willing to speak with you, they appear and you can have a conversation with them. During this time, the creature responds to you as they would have in life. If the creature isn't free or willing to appear, you can speak another name or choose another respite activity.

###### Saint's Epiphany

At the start of a respite, you can inspire yourself or another creature taking the same respite with divine knowledge. If the target makes a project roll during this respite, they can add 1d10 plus your Intuition score to the roll.

The gods send divine favor to you and your allies. While you are not dying, enemies take a bane on strikes against you or any ally within 3 squares of you.

##### Covenant of the Heart

You can maintain bonds with up to three willing creatures using your Invocation of the Heart feature. Additionally, you have the following ability.

<!-- -->

>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |           **Main action** |

> **Effect:** Each target is teleported to unoccupied spaces within 5 squares of a willing creature who you are bonded to with your Invocation of the Heart feature. You don't need line of effect to the bonded creature but you must be on the same world.

##### Divine Quartermaster

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose a treasure with a project goal equal to 50 times your level or less. You gain a divine version of this treasure that lasts until you finish another respite or it is consumed.

##### Font of Grace

Each time you use your Healing Grace ability, you gain 1 piety that can be spent only on that ability during the same turn. If you don't use this piety, it is lost. Additionally, you can use your Minor Miracle feature to return a creature to life even if you don't have their remains.

##### Gods' Library

You can gain access to information you need through prayer, so that you no longer require research materials for crafting and research projects (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects). Additionally, you add your level to project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. You also have any skills in the lore skill group you don't already have, and you gain a number of skills from any other skill groups equal to the number of skills you had in the lore skill group before you gained this feature.

##### Light of the Burning Sun

Sun infuses your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal rolled damage to another creature, that ability deals an extra 5 fire damage, or an extra 15 fire damage if the creature is undead. Additionally, you have fire immunity equal to your level, which is added to any other fire immunity you have.

##### Nature's Bounty

When you finish a respite, you can prepare a magic meal using local flora for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following benefits for creatures who consume the meal:

- Each creature gains immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage equal to your level. You can choose this benefit twice, choosing a different damage immunity each time.
- Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.
- Each creature gains an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.

Each benefit lasts until the creature who gains it finishes another respite.

##### Thunderstruck

Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal lightning or sonic damage to another creature, you gain 1 surge. Additionally, if you use an ability that force moves a creature, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Intuition score.

##### Trinity of Trickery

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->

> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |
>
> **Effect:** You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere within distance. These duplicates last until the end of the encounter. On each of their turns, the target can move each duplicate up to their speed. If the target is targeted by an ability, they can use a free triggered action to switch places with a duplicate within their line of effect, making the duplicate the target of the ability instead. When either duplicate takes damage, it is destroyed.

##### Word of Death Deferred

You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within distance of your Healing Grace ability dies and you are not dying, you can use a free triggered action to instead have that ally fall unconscious until they regain Stamina.

Additionally, your abilities deal an extra 5 damage to winded creatures.

##### Word of Fate Denied

When an ally within 10 squares takes damage that would leave them dying, you can use a free triggered action to make yourself or another willing creature within 10 squares of you the target of the triggering damage instead. The creature you choose takes the damage and suffers any effects associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.

##### Your Triumphs Are Remembered

The gods allow you and your companions to bask in the glory of past successes. Whenever you finish a respite, you and any other heroes who rested with you regain 1 Victory after your Victories are converted to XP. This Victory isn't converted into XP at the end of a subsequent respite.

Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Intuition score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.

#### Divine Power

You have an epic resource called divine power. Each time you finish a respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend divine power on your abilities as if it were piety.

Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any conduit abilities you don't have, as the gods answer your prayers with temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have that usually costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.

Divine power remains until you spend it.

#### Most Pious

When you roll for piety at the start of your turn in combat and you pray, you gain 1 additional piety.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
