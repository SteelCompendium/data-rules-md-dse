## Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mystery that which cannot be known. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

**As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, debilitate enemies, ward yourself and allies, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your elemental specialization determines which of these talents you excel at.**

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities bolster your body and grant the power to permanently create and shape physical terrain.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities devastate enemies and melt objects to slag.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of decay. Rot abilities harm and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the mystery. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance your allies' power, and alter your enemies' power for the worse.

You choose an elemental specialization from the following options: earth, fire, green, or void. Your elemental specialization is your subclass, and your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels, including one of the following benefits. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) (*Quick Build:* Fire.)

##### Earth: Acolyte of Earth

You harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an ability that has the Earth and Magic keywords, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.

##### Fire: Acolyte of Fire

You become an expert at wielding destructive flames. Your abilities that have the Fire and Magic keywords gain a +1 bonus to rolled damage. Your Hurl Element ability (see below) also gains this bonus when you use it to deal fire damage.

##### Green: Acolyte of the Green

You harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures using an ability that has the Green and Magic keywords and that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.

##### Void: Acolyte of the Mystery

You use your immersion in the mystery of void magic to expand the reach of that magic better than other mages. The distance of all your abilities that have the Magic, Ranged, and Void keywords increases by 2 squares.

#### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

##### Essence in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain 1 essence.

You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

##### Essence Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence equal to your Victories.

#### Hurl Element

You have the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

###### Hurl Element

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at a foe.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**          | **üéØ One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 2 + R damage
- **12-16:** 4 + R damage
- **17+:** 6 + R damage

**Effect:** When you make this strike, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

#### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.

#### Practical Magic

You have the following ability.

###### Practical Magic

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

| **Magic**              | **Maneuver** |
| ---------------------- | -----------: |
| **üìè Self; see below** |  **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.
- You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If you choose this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional square for each essence spent.

#### 1st-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

#### 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earth          | Motivate Earth             |
| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |
| Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

##### A Beyonding of Vision

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. Additionally, you always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability.

###### Shared Void Sense

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**        | **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void Sense ability.

##### It Is the Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

##### Motivate Earth

You have the following ability.

###### Motivate Earth

*The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command.*

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it. You can instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

##### Return to Formlessness

You have the following ability.

###### Return to Formlessness

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

| **Fire, Magic, Melee** |           **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**         | **üéØ One mundane object** |

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to melt or combust, destroying it. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object you touch is destroyed.

#### Specialization Triggered Action

Your elemental specialization grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Specialization Triggered Actions table.

###### Elemental Specialization Triggered Actions Table

**Trigger:** The target force moves a creature or object.

**Effect:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score.

**Spend 1 Essence:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to twice your Reason score instead.

###### Skin Like Castle Walls

*You cover yourself or an ally in protective stone.*

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

##### Enchantment of Battle

###### Invigorating Growth (3 Essence)

*Mushrooms erupt from a foe, sapping their vitality to spread strengthening spores.*

| **Green, Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main action** |

- **17+:** 11 + R poison damage

**Effect:** Mushrooms cover the target's body. While the mushrooms are on the target, you and any ally adjacent to the target gain 1 surge whenever the target takes damage. The mushrooms can be removed by the target or an adjacent creature as a main action.

###### Ripples in the Earth (3 Essence)

*Like a stone was dropped into a pond, waves in the earth radiate from you.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic** |               **Main action** |

A pillar of earth rises out of the ground in that square, with a height in squares up to your Reason score. The pillar can't collide with any creatures or objects, nor can it force creatures raised by it to collide with other creatures or objects.

###### 5-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 5 essence to use. (*Quick Build:* Conflagration.)

###### Conflagration (5 Essence)

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** |   **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------ | -------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         | **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** You open up two holes with 1-square openings that are 4 squares deep, which can be placed on any mundane surface within distance. You can place these holes next to each other to create fewer holes with wider openings. When the holes open, make a separate power roll for each creature on the ground above a hole and small enough to fall in. (You can't score a critical hit with this ability because it uses a maneuver.)

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** The target can shift 1 square from the edge of the hole to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice.
- **12-16:** The target falls into the hole.
- **17+:** The target falls into the hole and can't reduce the height of the fall.

**Persistent 1:** At the start of your turn, you open another hole, making a power roll against each creature who could fall into the hole when it opens without spending essence.

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |            **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**        | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target can move through solid matter, they ignore difficult terrain, and their movement can't provoke opportunity attacks. If the target ends their turn inside solid matter, they are forced out into the space where they entered it and this effect ends.

**Persistent 1:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

###### Test of Rain (5 Essence)

*You call down a rain that burns your enemies and restores your allies.*

| **Area, Green, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |

- **12-16:** 6 acid damage
- **17+:** 10 acid damage

**Effect:** You can end one effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Each ally in the area also gains this benefit.

### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
| Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
| Void           | There Is No Space Between |

##### Disciple of Earth

Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, and you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level past 2nd.

##### Disciple of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can make that damage fire damage.

##### Disciple of the Green

You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T animal who fits the rodent type. When you take on an animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls undamaged to the ground (your choice). When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. When you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others.

| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Earth          | Summon Source of Earth |
| Fire           | The Flame Primordial   |

| Void           | Black Hole Star        |

##### Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced movement ignores stability for your allies.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal to your level.

##### Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).

##### The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return to Formlessness ability instead.

Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is wearing mostly metal.

*The ground rumbles as an elemental bursts forth, ready to serve.*

| **Earth, Magic, Ranged** | **Main action** |
| ------------------------ | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance. The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is dismissed at the start of your next turn.

The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you can't use this ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.

**Persistent 2:** The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of your next turn.

#### 11-Essence Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 11 essence to use.

###### Heart of the Wode (11 Essence)

*You call forth one of the Great Tree's many splinters to provide for your every need.*

| **Green, Magic, Ranged** | **Main action** |
| ------------------------ | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**         |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has 100 Stamina and can't be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree to use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when you start your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn, or you can stand up if you are prone. Each ally within distance also gains this benefit.

Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained until the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a main action to end the effect early.

###### Muse of Fire (11 Essence)

*The fire burns hot enough to sear the face of any god watching.*

| **Area, Fire, Magic, Ranged** |               **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **üìè 5 cube within 10**       | **üéØ Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 7 fire damage; the Director loses 2 Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*)
- **12-16:** 10 fire damage; the Director loses 3 Malice
- **17+:** 15 fire damage; the Director loses 4 Malice

**Effect:** The Director's Malice can become negative as a result of this ability.

###### Return to Oblivion (11 Essence)

*You create a tear in reality that could consume everything.*

| **Area, Magic, Ranged, Void** | **Main action** |
| ----------------------------- | --------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10**              |  **üéØ Special** |

**Effect:** You create a size 1L vortex that lasts until the end of the encounter. At the start of each combat round while the vortex is unoccupied, the vortex vertical pulls 3 each enemy within 5 squares of it. Each enemy who enters the vortex or starts their turn there is knocked prone. At the end of the round, if a winded enemy who is not a leader or solo creature is in the vortex, they are instantly destroyed.

###### World Torn Asunder (11 Essence)

*You stomp your foot and quake the whole world over.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic** |               **Main action** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **12-16:** M < AVERAGE, prone
- **17+:** M < STRONG, prone

**Effect:** You create a fissure in the ground adjacent to you that is a 10 x 2 line and 6 squares deep. Each creature in the area who is prone and size 2 or smaller falls in. Other creatures can enter the fissure or can shift to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice outside it.

###### Earth Rejects You (11 Essence)

*Everyone and everything gets blown away in an eruption of rocks and debris.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic, Ranged** |                          **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: |
| **üìè 5 cube within 10**        | **üéØ Each enemy and object in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **‚â§11:** 6 damage

**Persistent 2:** At the start of your turn, you can use a maneuver to use this ability again without spending essence.

###### The Green Defends Its Servants (11 Essence)

| **üìè Ranged 10**         | **üéØ Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** You conjure an elemental shield that protects the target until the end of your next turn. While the shield is active, the target can take the Defend main action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains 30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or until the effect ends. If this temporary Stamina disappears, the effect ends and the shield explodes, dealing 10 damage to each enemy within 5 squares of the target.

**Persistent 2:** The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

###### Prism (11 Essence)

*You split your essence, allowing you to cast multiple effects at once.*

| **Magic, Void** | **Main action** |
| --------------- | --------------: |
| **üìè Self**     |     **üéØ Self** |

**Effect:** You use up to three heroic abilities whose essence costs total 11 or less, spending no additional essence beyond the cost of this ability. You can shift up to 2 squares between your use of each ability.

###### Unquenchable Fire (11 Essence)

*You let fly a fiery missile braided with pure primal energy.*

| **Fire, Magic, Ranged, Strike** |            **Main action** |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------: |

- **12-16:** 18 + R fire damage; I < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** 25 + R fire damage; I < STRONG, dazed (save ends)

**Effect:** This damage ignores immunity.

### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

#### Breath

You have an epic resource called breath. Each time you finish a respite, you gain breath equal to the XP you gain. You can spend any number of breath to gain essence (no action required). When you do, 1 breath becomes 3 essence.

Breath remains until you convert it to essence.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Reason score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.

#### Essential Being

When you gain essence at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 essence instead of 3.

#### One

You become the embodiment of the element of your chosen specialization. Whenever you use magic, elemental motes flit around you and your skin changes to reflect your element, taking on an earthen or stony appearance for earth, appearing like flickering flame for fire, gaining a leaf pattern for green, and becoming a starry expanse for void. Additionally, you gain one of the following benefits, as shown on the One Specialization Features table.

###### One Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Earth          | Master of Earth |
| Fire           | Master of Fire  |
| Green          | Master of Green |
| Void           | Master of Void  |

##### Master of Earth

You have damage immunity 5.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains, level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.

##### Master of Fire

The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and applies to all your magic abilities.

Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.

##### Master of Green

The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.

Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.

As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for the longest time.

##### Master of Void

Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport.

Additionally, your mind is connected to the mystery and helps you find the answers you seek. You no longer require project sources for research projects. Whenever you use a respite activity to make a project roll for a research project, you automatically complete the project.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.
