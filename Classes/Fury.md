## Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you. You unleash it! Your experience in the wild taught you the secrets of predators, and now, like the raptor, the panther, the wolf, you channel unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial Chaos is your ally. Let others use finesse to clean up the wreckage left in your wake.

**As a fury, you devastate foes with overwhelming might, hurl yourself and enemies around the battlefield, and grow stronger as your ferocity increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and an Agility of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- 2, −1, −1
- 1, 1, −1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Might − 2

**Average Potency:** Might − 1

**Strong Potency:** Might

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 10

**Skills:** You gain the Nature skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the exploration or intrigue skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Alertness, Jump, Nature.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Primordial Aspect

You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Berserker.)

- **Berserker:** You channel your ferocity into physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your ferocity into instinct and cunning, challenging the order of civilization. You have the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your ferocity into primordial storms and can take on the form of an animal or an animal hybrid form. You have the Track skill.

Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Ferocity

Within the heat of battle, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called ferocity.

> **Where's My Maneuver?**
>
> Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, you might find yourself asking, "Where's the special maneuver for the fury?" The answer is that the class doesn't need its own maneuver, because most of the time, the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.

##### Ferocity in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.

##### Ferocity Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain ferocity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost ferocity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs ferocity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited ferocity on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of ferocity equal to your Victories.

#### Growing Ferocity

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of ferocity you have (see 1st-Level Aspect Features for details). These benefits last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of ferocity you spend during your turn.

Some Growing Ferocity benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the various Growing Ferocity tables in this section.

Additionally, you automatically sense any source of one of those damage types within 10 squares, such as a fire or a source of elemental power.

#### Primordial Strike

You can manifest your ferocity directly as an elemental force created by the Primordial Chaos. As part of any strike, you can spend 1 ferocity to gain 1 surge that must be used for that strike.

- **12-16:** 13 + M damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 18 + M damage; M < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target is slowed this way, any other effect that would make the target slowed instead makes them restrained by this ability.

### 10th-Level Features

As a 10th-level fury, you gain the following features.

#### Chaos Incarnate

Your mastery of elemental forces protects and emboldens you. If you are a berserker or reaver, you have immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, and sonic damage equal to twice your Might score. If you are a stormwight, your damage immunity from your Primordial Storm feature (see Stormwight Kits) increases to three times your Might score.

When any elemental or any other creature whose abilities deal acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have P < STRONG, they are frightened of you (save ends).

Additionally, when you use Primordial Strike, you can spend up to 3 ferocity, gaining 1 surge per ferocity spent to use for that strike.

#### Characteristic Increase

Your Might and Agility scores each increase to 5.

#### Growing Ferocity Improvement

Your Growing Ferocity feature provides additional benefits when you have 12 or more ferocity.

#### Perk

You gain one crafting, exploration, or intrigue perk of your choice.

#### Primordial Ferocity

The first time you take damage each combat round, you gain 3 ferocity instead of 2.

#### Primordial Power

You have an epic resource called primordial power. Each time you finish a respite, you gain primordial power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend primordial power on your abilities as if it were ferocity.

Additionally, you can spend any amount of primordial power as a free maneuver, ending one effect on you for each primordial power spent.

You can also spend 3 primordial power to create a portal to Quintessence without needing a source of elemental power.

Primordial power remains until you spend it.

#### Skill

You gain one skill of your choice.

### Stormwight Kits

The stormwight primordial aspect lets you channel your ferocity into the form of an animal and grants you knowledge of one stormwight kit of your choice. You can master additional stormwight kits through play, changing them out during a respite as with any other kit (see Chapter 6: Kits).

#### Kit Features

##### Aspect Benefits and Animal Form

**Spend 1 Ferocity:** As a free maneuver, you can shapeshift a second time, either into another animal form, into your hybrid form, or back into your true form.
