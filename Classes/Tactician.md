## Tactician

Strategist. Defender. Leader. With weapon in hand, you lead allies into the maw of battle, barking out commands that inspire your fellow heroes to move faster and strike more precisely. All the while, you stand between your compatriots and death, taunting the followers of evil to best you if they can.

**As a tactician, you have abilities that heal your allies and grant them increased damage, movement, and attacks, even as you leave your enemies struggling to respond.**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and a Reason of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- 2, −1, −1
- 1, 1, −1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason − 2

**Average Potency:** Reason − 1

**Strong Potency:** Reason

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 10

**Skills:** You gain the Lead skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from Alertness, Architecture, Blacksmithing, Brag, Culture, Empathize, Fletching, Mechanics, Monsters, Search, Strategy, or the skills of the exploration skill group. (*Quick Build:* Lead, Monsters, Strategy.)

### 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level tactician, you gain the following features.

#### Tactical Doctrine

Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)

- **Insurgent:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.
- **Mastermind:** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
- **Vanguard:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.

Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

#### Focus

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

##### Focus in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or any ally damages a creature marked by you (see Mark below), you gain 1 focus. The first time in a combat round that any ally within 10 squares of you uses a heroic ability, you gain 1 focus.

You lose any remaining focus at the end of the encounter.

##### Focus Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the tactician, but they might appear in future products.)

<!-- -->
> **Tactician Abilities Explained**
>
> Many of the tactician's abilities grant allies extra movement, damage, and actions. But what's happening in the fiction to allow this? The tactician is an incredible strategist and inspiring leader who is quick to give commands and inspiration that causes their allies to act. The tactician can quickly read the battlefield, analyze enemies, and then bark orders and encouragement that pushes their allies to greatness. Many of the names of the tactician's abilities are the actual commands they give their friends!

#### 1st-Level Doctrine Feature

Your tactical doctrine grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Doctrine Features table.

###### 1st-Level Doctrine Features Table

| Doctrine   | Feature             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Covert Operations   |
| Mastermind | Studied Commander   |
| Vanguard   | Commanding Presence |

##### Commanding Presence

You command any room you walk into. While you are present during a negotiation, each hero with you treats their Renown as 2 higher than usual. Additionally, each hero with you during a combat encounter has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation.

##### Covert Operations

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests using any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist another creature with any test made using a skill from the intrigue group.

At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of a negotiation.

##### Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12: Downtime Projects for more information.)

Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:

- **≤11:** The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
- **12-16:** The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
- **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.

The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:

- **≤11:** The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC in the negotiation.
- **12-16:** The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.
- **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

#### Doctrine Triggered Action

Your tactical doctrine grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Doctrine Triggered Actions table.

###### Doctrine Triggered Actions Table

| Doctrine   | Triggered Action |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Insurgent  | Advanced Tactics |
| Mastermind | Overwatch        |
| Vanguard   | Parry            |

<!-- -->
> ###### Advanced Tactics
>
> *Your leadership aids an ally.*
>
> | **Ranged**       |   **Triggered** |
> | ---------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One ally** |
>
> **Trigger:** The target deals damage to another creature.
>
> **Effect:** The target gains 2 surges, which they can use on the triggering damage.
>
> **Spend 1 Focus:** If the damage has any potency effect associated with it, the potency is increased by 1.

<!-- -->
> ###### Overwatch
>
> *Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.*
>
> | **Ranged**       |       **Triggered** |
> | ---------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Trigger:** The target moves.
>
> **Effect:** At any time during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against them.
>
> **Spend 1 Focus:** If the target has R < AVERAGE, they are slowed (EoT).

<!-- -->
> ###### Parry
>
> *Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.*
>
> | **Melee, Weapon** |           **Triggered** |
> | ----------------- | ----------------------: |
> | **📏 Melee 2**    | **🎯 Self or one ally** |
>
> **Trigger:** A creature deals damage to the target.
>
> **Effect:** You can shift 1 square. If the target is you, or if you end this shift adjacent to the target, the target takes half the damage. If the damage has any potency effect associated with it, the potency is decreased by 1.
>
> **Spend 1 Focus:** This ability's distance becomes Melee 1 + your Reason score, and you can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score instead of 1 square.

#### Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of arms and armor, and have developed techniques to optimize their use. You can use and gain the benefits of two kits, including both their signature abilities. Whenever you would choose or change one kit, you can choose or change your second kit as well. See Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor, Sniper.)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.)

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

- Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon
- Stability Bonus: +1
- Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
- Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4
- Speed Bonus: +1
- Ranged Distance Bonus: +10
- Disengage Bonus: +1
- You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to 3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13 damage.

#### Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Mark
>
> *You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe—with devastating effect.*
>
> | **Ranged**       |        **Maneuver** |
> | ---------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Effect:** The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within distance.
>
> You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.
>
> While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:
>
> - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.
> - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.
> - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
> - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
>
> You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.

#### Strike Now

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### "Strike Now!"
>
> *Your foe left an opening. You point this out to an ally!*
>
> | **Ranged**       | **Main action** |
> | ---------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One ally** |
>
> **Effect:** The target can use a signature ability as a free triggered action.
>
> **Spend 5 Focus:** You target two allies instead of one.

#### Tactician Abilities

You are a formidable combatant in your own right, but your greatest strength is the abilities you wield that let you shape control of the battlefield.

##### Kit Signature Ability

Each kit from your Field Arsenal feature grants you a signature ability. Signature abilities can be used at will.

##### Heroic Abilities

Your heroic abilities cover a range of combat tactics, all of which require focus to use.

### 2nd-Level Features

As a 2nd-level tactician, you gain the following features.

#### Perk

You gain one exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue perk of your choice. See Chapter 7: Perks.

#### 2nd-Level Doctrine Feature

Your tactical doctrine grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Doctrine Features table.

| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Infiltration Tactics |
| Mastermind | Goaded               |
| Vanguard   | Melee Superiority    |

##### Goaded

You have learned to leverage your marked foes' psychology and goad them into acting before they're tactically ready. Whenever a creature marked by you uses a strike that targets you or any ally within your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to change one target of the strike to you or another ally within your line of effect. The new target must be within distance of the ability and within line of effect of the creature using it.

##### Infiltration Tactics

You have trained your squad to work together, stay silent, and wait for the opportune time to strike. Whenever you or any ally within 10 squares of you becomes hidden, that creature gains 1 surge.

##### Melee Superiority

After constant drills, you can more accurately anticipate an enemy's plan and thwart their attempts to move across the battlefield. Whenever you make an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

**Mark Benefit:** When a creature marked by you attempts to move or shift within distance of your melee free strike, you can use a free triggered action and spend 2 focus to make a melee free strike against that creature.

Your tactical doctrine grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

>

>
> - **≤11:** 2 + R damage; R < WEAK, frightened (save ends)

> **Effect:** You move up to your speed toward the triggering ally, ending this movement adjacent to them or in the nearest square if you can't reach an adjacent square.

> - **≤11:** R < WEAK, the target is frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)
> - **12-16:** R < AVERAGE, the target is frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)
