#### Mountain

The Mountain kit does exactly what it says on the tin. You don heavy armor and raise a heavy weapon to stand strong against your foes, quickly demolishing them when it's your turn to strike.

##### Equipment

You wear heavy armor and wield a heavy weapon.

##### Kit Bonuses

**Stamina Bonus:** +9 per echelon

**Stability Bonus:** +2

**Melee Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+4

##### Signature Ability

###### Pain for Pain

*An enemy who tagged you will pay for that.*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** 3 + M or A damage
- **12-16:** 5 + M or A damage
- **17+:** 13 + M or A damage
