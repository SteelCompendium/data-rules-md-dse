#### Battlemind

Who says lightly armored heroes can't also be hard to move? You just need to employ some psionics! The Battlemind kit harnesses the power of your mind to make you harder to move—and to make your foes easier to push around.

##### Equipment

You wear light armor and wield a medium weapon.

##### Kit Bonuses

**Stamina Bonus:** +3 per echelon

**Speed Bonus:** +2

**Stability Bonus:** +1

**Melee Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2

##### Signature Ability

###### Unmooring

*Your weapon unleashes psionic energy that reduces your target's weight.*
