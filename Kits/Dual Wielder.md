#### Dual Wielder

The Dual Wielder kit is for folks who want to excel at using two weapons at the same time. Your fighting style maximizes the power of each weapon you have in hand, making you a whirling dealer of death.

##### Equipment

You wear medium armor and wield a light weapon and a medium weapon.

##### Kit Bonuses

**Stamina Bonus:** +6 per echelon

**Speed Bonus:** +2

**Melee Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2

**Disengage Bonus:** +1

##### Signature Ability

###### Double Strike

*Why strike once when you could do it twice?*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |                 **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------: |
| **üìè Melee 1**            | **üéØ Two creatures or objects** |

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **‚â§11:** 4 damage
- **12-16:** 6 damage
- **17+:** 8 damage

**Effect:** If you use this ability on your turn, you can use it against one target, then use your maneuver and your move action for that turn before using the ability against a second target. You still use the same power roll for both targets.
