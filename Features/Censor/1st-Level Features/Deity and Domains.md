      Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and
      Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world.
      With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and
      choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.


      After choosing your deity, pick one domain from their portfolio. Your
      choice of domain determines many of the features you'll gain from this
      class. (*Quick Build:* Cavall as deity and War as domain.)
