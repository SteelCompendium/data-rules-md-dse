#### Saved for a Worse Fate

*Drink this. You'll need all your strength for what lies ahead!*

**Prerequisite:** The entire party is killed or captured by sapient foes.

**Effect:** After being defeated, each character awakes, alive and with full Stamina and Recoveries. You are all captives of the creatures who defeated you, and a gruesome end awaits you-unless you can escape or overcome the nefarious challenge your captors have planned.

The Director chooses one of the following benefits, based on the fate your captors have in mind for you. Each hero gains the same benefit. Additionally, you must face an encounter, montage test, or adventure related to the benefit, as the Director determines.

- *Gladiators:* You must fight to the death for your captors' amusement. Your intended opponents wield or guard a trinket or leveled treasure, which you can earn if you are victorious.
- *Prey:* Your captors plan to release you and hunt you down, but it's no fun unless you offer a challenge. Each of you is given a medicinal draught that grants a +1 bonus to speed and increases your Recoveries by 2. This benefit lasts until the end of your next respite.
- *Sacrifices:* You are to be dropped in a volcano, fed to a sacred monster, abandoned in a desert, or otherwise sacrificed to a higher power. You are bedecked with holy jewelry. Each hero earns 1 Wealth.
- *Saviors:* Your captors fear an even stronger foe, and they want you to defeat this enemy for them. You can even keep any treasure you find while doing so.
