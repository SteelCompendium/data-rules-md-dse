#### Ship Captain

*Up anchor, shipmates! 'Tisn't gold but glory we seek!*

**Prerequisite:** You acquire a ship, airship, or similar vessel.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Deep-Sea Diver:* You can automatically swim at full speed while moving.
- *Ship Speaker:* You magically know the location of any ship controlled by your party even while you aren't aboard. You can telepathically communicate with anyone on board one of your ships who understands a language, and they can respond, no matter your distance from the ship.
- *Signal Flags:* While aboard a ship, you can communicate with and conduct negotiations with another ship up to 5 miles away, as long as you and creatures on the other ship have line of effect to each other. You gain an edge on Presence tests made while negotiating in this way.
- *Trained Crewmember:* You gain an edge on tests made to handle air or sea vessels.
