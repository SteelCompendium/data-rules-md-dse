#### City Rat

*Stay out all night, visit the dives. Get in a fight, run from the cops. That's the real city.*

**Prerequisite:** You have spent at least five respites in a metropolis.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Discerning Shopper:* When looking for an item prerequisite for a crafting project, you can remember meeting someone who might have the itemâ€”or at least information about it.
- *One with the Crowd:* While you're using one or more creatures as cover, you gain an edge on tests made to hide and sneak.
- *Street Smart:* While in a settlement, you can't be surprised.
