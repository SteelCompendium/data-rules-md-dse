#### Presumed Dead

*But... you're dead. We went to your funeral.*

**Prerequisite:** You die in a way that prevents your body from being recovered or examined (for instance, by falling off a cliff).

**Effect:** While it might appear that you died, you did not. Instead, you regain 1 Stamina and can spend 1 or more Recoveries. Additionally, you gain a 1st-echelon trinket of the Director's choice (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) earlier in this chapter).

At a dramatic moment determined by the Director, you rejoin your party with an explanation for your narrow escape, and how you found your new trinket along the way.
