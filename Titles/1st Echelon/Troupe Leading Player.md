#### Troupe Leading Player

*We're actors! We're the opposite of people!*

**Prerequisite:** The party has successfully performed as a troupe of actors, circus performers, or other entertainers.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Flying Circus:* When you are adjacent to a willing ally on their turn, you can use a triggered action to push them up to 2 squares if their size is the same as yours, or 4 squares if they are smaller. If this push causes the ally to fall, they can use a maneuver before they fall to reduce the height of the fall by 2.
- *Spotlight:* You magically cause a creature within 10 squares to shed light for 5 squares. This light lasts for 1 minute, until the creature is more than 10 squares away from you, or until you dismiss the effect (no action required). While illuminated, a creature can't sneak or hide, they take a bane on tests made to perform any action secretly, and they gain an edge on tests made using the Lead, Music, or Perform skills.
- *Supporting Player:* You gain an edge on group tests using Presence and on tests made to assist another creature with a Presence test.
- *Work the Crowd:* While any of your allies is playing music or performing, you gain an edge on tests made to conceal objects, hide, pick pockets, or sneak.
