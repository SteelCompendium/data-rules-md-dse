#### Faction Officer

*If you want or need something, talk to me. I have a certain... influence in these parts.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Faction Member title, and you greatly advance the faction's goals.

**Effect:** You are given a position of great authority in your faction. Additionally, you gain the following benefits:

- *Requisition:* When you gain this title, you gain a 1st- or 2nd-echelon magic trinket of your choice from your faction (see [Treasures](#page-327-2) earlier in this chapter). Whenever you gain a level, you can swap the trinket out for another one.
- *You're the Boss:* Lower-ranking members of your faction follow your routine orders. In nonroutine matters, you gain an edge on tests made to influence those characters' behavior.
