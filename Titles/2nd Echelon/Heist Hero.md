#### Heist Hero

*Everybody know their assignments? All right, let's go.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Troupe Leading Player title, and you have used planning and teamwork to execute a theft that went (reasonably) according to plan.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Mother Hen:* You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to psionically enhance up to five willing creatures within 10 squares of you who understand a language you know. For the next hour, you and each target can communicate telepathically with each other no matter the distance between you.
- *Sneakers:* You gain the Sneak skill. If you already have this skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the Sneak skill. During group tests, you can both use the Sneak skill and assist another hero using the Sneak skill.
- *Timely Distraction:* You have the following triggered action.

###### Timely Distraction

*Coming through with hot soup!<br/> I better watch out for that banana peel!*

| **Ranged**       |       **Triggered** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **üìè Ranged 10** | **üéØ One creature** |

**Trigger:** An ally makes a test to lie to, pick the pocket of, hide from, or sneak by the target and doesn't like the outcome.

**Effect:** You momentarily attract the target's notice to let your ally reroll their test. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again against the same target for 1 hour.
