#### Sworn Hunter

*I will follow you to the ends of the earthâ€”just so I can kick you off the edge.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Marshal title, and you take down an entire criminal organization.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Hunter's Oath:* As a main action, you swear a hunter's oath against a creature within 10 squares who you have line of effect to. This oath lasts until the target dies or until you swear a hunter's oath against a different creature. As long as the hunter's oath lasts, you magically know the direction to the target if they are within 50 miles of you, and your damage-dealing abilities gain a +5 damage bonus against the target.
- *Particular Set of Skills:* You know a skill from the intrigue skill group.
- *We're In This Together:* When you have a creature grabbed and take damage from an ability not used by that creature, the grabbed creature takes the same damage.
