#### Arena Fighter

*You've never seen the showstopper? The move so brutal it was banned in the arena? Come closer and I'll show it to you.*

**Prerequisite:** You are victorious in battle in an arena or some other public contest of combat.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Dirty Fighting:* While you are standing, your melee strikes gain a +3 damage bonus against prone creatures. Additionally, being prone doesn't impose a bane on your strikes.
- *Foes as Weapons:* Whenever you have a creature of your size or smaller grabbed, you can use them as a weapon when you make a melee weapon free strike. Both the target and the grabbed enemy take the strike's damage.
- *Instant Celebrity:* You earn 1 Renown.
- *Showstopper:* You have the following ability, which can be paid for using the Heroic Resource of your class.
