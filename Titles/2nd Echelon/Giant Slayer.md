#### Giant Slayer

*Come back here, puny one, and let me crush you!*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with the Giant keyword, such as a fire giant chief.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Smallfolk Dodge:* Any creature of size 2 or larger takes a bane on strikes against you.
- *The Harder They Fall:* You have the following ability, which can be paid for using the Heroic Resource of your class.

###### The Harder They Fall (7 Heroic Resource)

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** 7 damage; M < WEAK, prone and can't stand (save ends)
- **12-16:** 11 damage; M < AVERAGE, prone and can't stand (save ends)
- **17+:** 16 damage; M < STRONG, prone and can't stand (save ends)

**Special:** If the target is size 2 or larger, you gain an edge on this ability.

- *Up the Beanstalk:* You have the Climb skill. If you already have this skill, you instead gain an edge on tests made using the Climb skill. While you're climbing a creature, the creature has a double bane on strikes against you and you have a double edge on tests made to stay on the creature.
