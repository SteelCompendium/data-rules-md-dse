#### Unchained

*I'll never get away with it? My dear, I already have.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Heist Hero title, and you have stolen a precious object or escaped from captivity while evading guards of 8th level or higher.

**Effect:** Your choice of your Might or Agility increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6). Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

- *Bye-Bye:* You can use a maneuver to teleport yourself and each willing ally within 5 squares of you to new positions within 10 squares of your original starting point. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you earn 1 or more Victories.
- *Laughs at Locks:* Whenever you make a test to open a lock or break a restraint, you don't need any tools and you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome.
- *Slippery:* You can't be grabbed against your will.
