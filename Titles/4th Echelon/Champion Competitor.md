#### Champion Competitor

*Marduk uses the Beldoit Gambit! Avanna counters with the Iron Defense and goes on the attack! Marduk's last tower is knocked down! And just like that, we have a new... world... champion!*

**Prerequisite:** You beat the best in the world at a game or sport.

**Effect:** A characteristic used during the competition increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6). Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

- *Best of the Best:* Choose a skill you used during the competition. You gain a +4 bonus to tests made using that skill instead of a +2 bonus
- *Glory and Riches:* You earn 2 Renown and 1 Wealth.
- *I'll Just Take the Prize:* You gain a trinket or leveled treasure of the Director's choice.
