#### Reborn

*I remember this world. I suppose my task is not yet complete.*

**Prerequisite:** You died in glorious battle while on a quest for a higher power.

**Effect:** A god or other powerful being has determined that it is not yet your time to die. Your body fades away, but you reappear alive 24 hours later in a location of your choice. You regain all your Stamina and Recoveries, and your choice of your Intuition or Presence increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6).

Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

- *Holy Weapon:* You have a leveled treasure of the Director's choice.
- *Kill Me Once, Shame On You:* Choose a creature keyword belonging to one of the creatures who defeated you. Any creature with that keyword takes a bane on ability rolls against you.
- *Memories of the Beyond:* You have two skills of your choice.

**Special:** If a hakaan gains this title as a result of using their Doomsight trait, they lose that trait.
