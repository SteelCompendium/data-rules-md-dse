#### Enlightened

*Don't you see? This world that seems so real to you is nothing but a game, and all the people merely pieces!*

**Prerequisite:** You learn a cosmic truth that alters your understanding of reality.

**Effect:** Your choice of your Reason or Intuition increases by 1 (to a maximum of 6). Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

- *Cosmic Revelation:* When you make a test with a skill from the lore skill group and obtain a tier 1 or tier 2 outcome, you can instead obtain a tier 3 outcome. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you earn 1 or more Victories.
- *Mind Over Matter:* Whenever you spend a Recovery, you can end one condition on yourself.
- *Rearrange the Game Pieces:* You can reach behind the curtain and alter reality. At the start of combat, choose yourself or any creature within 5 squares. The chosen target must move up to their speed to a space you choose, but can't enter damaging terrain or terrain that could impose a condition on them. The target doesn't appear to move or teleport to that spaceâ€”they are simply there. No one but you has any memory of the target's previous position.
