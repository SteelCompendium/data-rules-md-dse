#### Scarred

*Last time we fought, I gave you a little token to remember me by... now it appears you need another reminder of my power.*

**Prerequisite:** An enemy leader or solo creature reduces you to 0 Stamina.

**Effect:** You gain a visible scar in a location of your choice. Additionally, your Stamina maximum increases by 20, and the creature who scarred you takes a bane on abilities against you.

**Special:** You can gain this title multiple times. The second and each subsequent time that you gain it, your Stamima maximum doesn't increase..
