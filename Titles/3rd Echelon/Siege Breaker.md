#### Siege Breaker

*Best way to deal with a castle siege? Be on the outside.*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Battlefield Commander title, and you lead the defense of a settlement or fortification.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Death From Above:* When you gain an edge on an ability due to high ground, the ability gains a +8 damage bonus.
- *Hold the Line:* While you're within 5 squares of an ally, you and each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +3 bonus to stability.
- *Last Defender:* Whenever an ally within 5 squares is reduced to 0 Stamina, you gain temporary Stamina equal to the ally's level (or 1 if they have no level). If you already have temporary Stamina granted by this title, you increase your temporary Stamina by the amount you would have gained.
