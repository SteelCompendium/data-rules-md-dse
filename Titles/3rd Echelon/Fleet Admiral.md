#### Fleet Admiral

*All hail the Pirate Queen!*

**Prerequisite:** You have the Corsair title, and you lead a fleet of at least three ships.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *First Mate:* You have a pirate retainer, such as a **human warrior**, chosen by the Director from *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*. This retainer's level increases to your level.
- *Swashbuckler:* You can automatically climb at full speed while moving
- *Treasure Keeper:* You earn 1 Wealth.
- *Weather Wizard:* Once per day, you can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to magically alter mundane weather in a 5-mile radius around you. The weather moves with you and persists for 6 hours or until you dismiss it as a free maneuver. Choose from one of the following weather types:
    - *Calm:* Wind-powered vessels and technology cease working
    - *Fog:* Visibility is reduced to 6 squares.
    - *High Winds:* The speed of wind-powered vessels is doubled.
    - *Light Winds:* No effects due to weather.
    - *Storm:* The crew of an unsheltered wind-powered vessel must make a medium group Reason test. On a failure, the vessel needs repairs and moves at half speed until those repairs are made.
