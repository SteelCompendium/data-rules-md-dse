#### Demon Slayer

*F'lath v'korr en zaratha g'rrack.*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with the Demon keyword, such as a soulraker hivequeen, or you are possessed by a demon.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

*Demonic Lore:* You know the Proto-Ctholl language. Additionally, when you deal damage using a magic ability, you can change the ability's damage type to holy.

- *Lethe:* While you are winded, your strikes gain a +5 damage bonus
- *Made of Teeth:* Your body can sprout teeth in unusual places. Whenever a creature makes physical contact with you or starts their turn touching you, you can deal 5 damage to them (no action required).
- *Soulsight:* Any creature within 2 squares can't be hidden from you.

**Special:** When you make a Presence test and roll a natural 5 or lower, you are cursed to communicate in only Proto-Ctholl for 1 minute, whether you know that language or not.
