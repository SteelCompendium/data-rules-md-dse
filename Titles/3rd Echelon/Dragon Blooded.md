#### Dragon Blooded

*I stabbed the wyrm Axarthan in the heart and their silver blood washed over me, leaving me... as you see.*

**Prerequisite:** You defeat a leader or solo creature with the Dragon keyword, such as a gloom dragon.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Dragon Scaled:* Dragon scales grow on your body wherever the heart's blood of the dragon touched you. You gain the Wyrmplate signature trait from the dragon knight ancestry (see [Chapter 3](#page-35-0)).
- *Dragon Touched:* You gain 3 ancestry points to spend on purchased dragon knight ancestry traits.
