#### Teacher

*Someday, I'll understand how peeling these carrots for dinner relates to my elementalist training.*

**Prerequisite:** You train or command at least three lower-level members of your class.

**Effect:** You can travel with a student who shares your class. The student has the statistics of a 1st-level member of your class and has the same skills as you, but doesn't engage in combat. They can perform any out-of-combat tasks a 1st-level member of your class can perform. Whenever they make a test to assist you in a task, they can't obtain less than a tier 2 outcome on the test.
