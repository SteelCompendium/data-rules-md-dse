#### Armed and Dangerous

*I'm not picky. Any tool will suffice. A sword seems a most appropriate tool for this job.*

**Prerequisite:** You can't use kits, and you defeat five non-minion enemies using weapon abilities that don't have the Magic or Psionic keyword.

**Effect:** You can use and gain the benefits of kits.
